0,0,House Dem Aide We Didnt Even See Comeys Letter Until Jason Chaffetz Tweeted It,Darrell Lucus,"House Dem Aide We Didnt Even See Comeys Letter Until Jason Chaffetz Tweeted It By Darrell Lucus on October 30 2016 Subscribe Jason Chaffetz on the stump in American Fork Utah  image courtesy Michael Jolley available under a Creative CommonsBY license 
With apologies to Keith Olbermann there is no doubt who the Worst Person in The World is this weekFBI Director James Comey But according to a House Democratic aide it looks like we also know who the secondworst person is as well It turns out that when Comey sent his nowinfamous letter announcing that the FBI was looking into emails that may be related to Hillary Clintons email server the ranking Democrats on the relevant committees didnt hear about it from Comey They found out via a tweet from one of the Republican committee chairmen 
As we now know Comey notified the Republican chairmen and Democratic ranking members of the House Intelligence Judiciary and Oversight committees that his agency was reviewing emails it had recently discovered in order to see if they contained classified information Not long after this letter went out Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz set the political world ablaze with this tweet FBI Dir just informed me The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation Case reopened 
 Jason Chaffetz jasoninthehouse October 28 2016 
Of course we now know that this was not the case  Comey was actually saying that it was reviewing the emails in light of an unrelated casewhich we now know to be Anthony Weiners sexting with a teenager But apparently such little things as facts didnt matter to Chaffetz The Utah Republican had already vowed to initiate a raft of investigations if Hillary winsat least two years worth and possibly an entire terms worth of them Apparently Chaffetz thought the FBI was already doing his work for himresulting in a tweet that briefly roiled the nation before cooler heads realized it was a dud 
But according to a senior House Democratic aide misreading that letter may have been the least of Chaffetz sins That aide told Shareblue that his boss and other Democrats didnt even know about Comeys letter at the timeand only found out when they checked Twitter Democratic Ranking Members on the relevant committees didnt receive Comeys letter until after the Republican Chairmen In fact the Democratic Ranking Members didn receive it until after the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee Jason Chaffetz tweeted it out and made it public 
So lets see if weve got this right The FBI director tells Chaffetz and other GOP committee chairmen about a major development in a potentially politically explosive investigation and neither Chaffetz nor his other colleagues had the courtesy to let their Democratic counterparts know about it Instead according to this aide he made them find out about it on Twitter 
There has already been talk on Daily Kos that Comey himself provided advance notice of this letter to Chaffetz and other Republicans giving them time to turn on the spin machine That may make for good theater but there is nothing so far that even suggests this is the case After all there is nothing so far that suggests that Comey was anything other than grossly incompetent and tonedeaf 
What it does suggest however is that Chaffetz is acting in a way that makes Dan Burton and Darrell Issa look like models of responsibility and bipartisanship He didnt even have the decency to notify ranking member Elijah Cummings about something this explosive If that doesnt trample on basic standards of fairness I dont know what does 
Granted its not likely that Chaffetz will have to answer for this He sits in a ridiculously Republican district anchored in Provo and Orem it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R25 and gave Mitt Romney a punishing 78 percent of the vote in 2012 Moreover the Republican House leadership has given its full support to Chaffetz planned fishing expedition But that doesnt mean we cant turn the hot lights on him After all he is a textbook example of what the House has become under Republican control And he is also the Second Worst Person in the World About Darrell Lucus 
Darrell is a 30something graduate of the University of North Carolina who considers himself a journalist of the old school An attempt to turn him into a member of the religious right in college only succeeded in turning him into the religious rights worst nightmarea charismatic Christian who is an unapologetic liberal His desire to stand up for those who have been scared into silence only

Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy liberal Wellesley Massachusetts Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress  Speaking of Great Expectations Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed no debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school I am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us   the 400 of us Miss Rodham told her classmates After

of protestors as he criticized tactics Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented Black Power demagogues and elitist arrogance and repressive intolerance within the New Left similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal Trust Rodham ironically observed in 1969 this is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them everyone came up to me and said Talk about trust talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others Talk about the trust bust What can you say about it What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted The trust bust certainly busted Clintons 2016 plans She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her After Whitewater Travelgate the vast   conspiracy Benghazi and the missing emails Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons And distrust from the American people   Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to Novembers election   stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a lie a con alternative facts and a   assault on truth and reason  She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth As the history majors among you here today know all too well when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society she offered That is not hyperbole  Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long strange trip From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree More significantly she went from idealist to cynic as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show Way back when she lamented that for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible  Now as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House she wonders how her current station is even possible Why arent I 50 points ahead she asked in September In May she asks why she isnt president The woman famously dubbed a congenital liar by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in   theirs mind you not hers Getting stood up on Election Day like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day inspires dangerous delusions,0,ever get the feeling your life circles the

2,2,Why the Truth Might Get You Fired,Consortiumnewscom,"Why the Truth Might Get You Fired October 29 2016 
The tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results with the latter often overwhelming the former as in the Iraq War writes Lawrence Davidson 
By Lawrence Davidson 
For those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices some insight might be drawn from the following analysis The action here plays out in the United States but the lessons are probably universal 
Back in the early spring of 2003 George W Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the countrys dictator Saddam Hussein was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction The real reason went beyond that charge and included a longrange plan for regime change in the Middle East President George W Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card on right White House photo 
For our purposes we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily 
The short answer is Bush wanted indeed needed to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 911 attacks on the US Though he never gave up on that stratagem the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people already fixated on Afghanistan to support a war against Baghdad 
But the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful not because there was any hard evidence for the charge but because supposedly reliable witnesses in the persons of exiled antiSaddam Iraqis many on the US governments payroll  kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true 
What we had was a US leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq and informants who in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof  Likewise the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide US campaign generating both fear and war fever 
So the US and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program as well as chemical and biological weapons That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand 
On March 19 2003 Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that once in occupation of the country US inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons They did not Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them 
Social and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue 
The various US intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair and today 13 years later their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out  specifically how to tell when they are getting true intelligence and when they are being lied to Or as one intelligence worker has put it we need  help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen  To that end the CIA et al are in the market for academic assistance Ahmed Chalabi head of the Iraqi National Congress a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD 
A partnership is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ODNI which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent US intelligence agencies and the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine  The result of this collaboration will be a  permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board to coordinate programs in social and behavioral science research that might strengthen national security  
Despite this effort it is almost certain that the social and behavioral sciences cannot give the spy agencies what they want  a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations But even if they could it might well make no difference because the real problem is not to be found with the liars It is to be found with the believers 
The Believers 
It is simply not true as the ODNI leaders seem to assert that US intelligence agency personnel cannot tell more often than not that they are being lied to This is the case because there are thousands of middleechelon intelligence workers desk officers and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth  that is they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan Iraq Syria Libya Israel Palestine and elsewhere Director of National Intelligence James Clapper right talks with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office with John Brennan and other national security aides present Photo credit Office of Director of National Intelligence 
Therefore if someone feeds them snake oil they usually know it However having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors  those who got their appointments by accepting a prestructured worldview  have different criterion for what is true than do the analysts 
Listen to Charles Gaukel of the National Intelligence Council  yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies Gaukel has declared  Were looking for truth But were particularly looking for truth that works  Now what might that mean 
I can certainly tell you what it means historically It means that for the power brokers truth must match up fit with their worldview  their political and ideological precepts If it does not fit it does not work So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by group think ideological blinkers and a we know better attitude 
On the other hand as long as what youre selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe you can peddle them anything imaginary Iraqi nukes Israel as a Westernstyle democracy Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally Libya as a liberated country Bashar alAssad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria the Strategic Defense Initiative SDI aka Star Wars a world that is getting colder and not warmer American exceptionalism in all its glory  the list is almost endless 
What does this sad tale tell us If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence forget about the liars What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrowmindedness of the believers  the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class  presumptions that underpin their selfconfidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes 
It has happened this way so often and in so many places that it is the source of Shakespeares determination that what is past is prelude Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will  no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing Yet the middleechelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power Hope springs eternal",1,why the truth

3,3,15 Civilians Killed In Single US Airstrike Have Been Identified,Jessica Purkiss,"Videos 15 Civilians Killed In Single US Airstrike Have Been Identified The rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations   Photo of Hellfire missiles being loaded onto a US military Reaper drone in Afghanistan by Staff Sgt Brian FergusonUS Air Force 
The Bureau has been able to identify 15 civilians killed in a single US drone strike in Afghanistan last month  the biggest loss of civilian life in one strike since the attack on the Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital MSF last October 
The US claimed it had conducted a counterterrorism strike against Islamic State IS fighters when it hit Nangarhar province with missiles on September 28 But the next day the United Nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed 15 civilians and injured 13 others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elders return from a pilgrimage to Mecca 
The Bureau spoke to a man named Haji Rais who said he was the owner of the house that was targeted He said 15 people were killed and 19 others injured and provided their names listed below The Bureau was able to independently verify the identities of those who died 
Rais son a headmaster at a local school was among them Another man Abdul Hakim lost three of his sons in the attack 
Rais said he had no involvement with IS and denied US claims that IS members had visited his house before the strike He said I did not even speak to those sort of people on the phone let alone receiving them in my house 
The deaths amount to the biggest confirmed loss of civilian life in a single American strike in Afghanistan since the attack on the MSF hospital in Kunduz last October which killed at least 42 people 
The Nangarhar strike was not the only US attack to kill civilians in September The Bureaus data indicates that as many as 45 civilians and allied soldiers were killed in four American strikes in Afghanistan and Somalia that month 
On September 18 a pair of strikes killed eight Afghan policemen in Tarinkot the capital of Urozgan provice US jets reportedly hit a police checkpoint killing one officer before returning to target first responders The use of this tactic  known as a doubletap strike  is controversial because they often hit civilian rescuers 
The US told the Bureau it had conducted the strike against individuals firing on and posing a threat to Afghan forces The email did not directly address the allegations of Afghan policemen being killed 
At the end of the month in Somalia citizens burnt US flags on the streets of the northcentral city of Galcayo after it emerged a drone attack may have unintentionally killed 22 Somali soldiers and civilians The strike occurred on the same day as the one in Nangarhar 
In both the Somali and Afghan incidents the US at first denied that any noncombatants had been killed It is now investigating both the strikes in Nangarhar and Galcayo

7,7,Benoît Hamon Wins French Socialist Partys Presidential Nomination  The New York Times,Alissa J Rubin,PARIS     France chose an idealistic traditional   candidate in Sundays primary to represent the Socialist and   parties in the presidential election this spring The candidate Benoît Hamon 49 who ran on the slogan that he would make Frances heart beat bested Manuel Valls the former prime minister whose campaign has promoted more   policies and who has a strong    background Mr Hamon appeared to have won by a wide margin with incomplete returns showing him with an estimated 58 percent of the vote to Mr Vallss 41 percent Tonight the left holds its head up high again it is looking to the future Mr Hamon said addressing his supporters Our country needs the left but a modern innovative left he said Mr Hamons victory was the clearest sign yet that voters on the left want a break with the policies of President François Hollande who in December announced that he would not seek   However Mr Hamons strong showing is unlikely to change widespread assessments that   candidates have little chance of making it into the second round of voting in the general election The first round of the general election is set for April 23 and the runoff for May 7 The Socialist Party is deeply divided and one measure of its lack of popular enthusiasm was the relatively low number of people voting About two million people voted in the second round of the primary on Sunday in contrast with about 2 9 million in the second round of the last presidential primary on the left in 2011 However much of the conventional wisdom over how the elections will go has been thrown into question over the past week because the leading candidate François Fillon who represents the main   party the Republicans was accused of paying his wife large sums of money to work as his parliamentary aide While nepotism is legal in the French political system it is not clear that she actually did any work Prosecutors who specialize in financial malfeasance are reviewing the case Frances electoral system allows multiple candidates to run for president in the first round of voting but only the top two   go on to a second round Mr Hamon is entering a race that is already crowded on the left with candidates who include   Mélenchon on the far left and Emmanuel Macron an independent who served as economy minister in Mr Hollandes government and who embraces more   policies Unless he decides to withdraw Mr Fillon the mainstream right candidate will also run as will the extreme right candidate Marine Le Pen The two have been expected to go to the runoff Mr Hamons victory can be attributed at least in part to his image as an idealist and traditional leftist candidate who appeals to union voters as well as more environmentally concerned and socially liberal young people Unlike Mr Valls he also clearly distanced himself from some of Mr Hollandes more unpopular policies especially the economic ones Thomas Kekenbosch 22 a student and one of the leaders of the group the Youth With Benoît Hamon said Mr Hamon embodied a new hope for those on the left We have a perspective we have something to do to build Mr Kekenbosch said Mr Hollande had disappointed many young people because under him the party abandoned ideals such as support for workers that many   voters believe in according to Mr Kekenbosch Mr Hollandes government under pressure from the European Union to meet budget restraints struggled to pass labor code reforms to make the market more attractive to foreign investors and also to encourage French businesses to expand in France The measures ultimately passed after weeks of strikes but they were watered down and generated little concrete progress in improving Frances roughly 10 percent unemployment rate and its nearly 25 percent youth joblessness rate Mr Hamon strongly endorses a stimulus approach to improving the economy and has promised to phase in a universal income which would especially help young people looking for work but would also supplement the livelihood of   French workers The end goal would be to have everyone receive 750 euros per month about 840 We have someone that trusts us Mr Kekenbosch said who says I give you enough to pay for your studies You can have a scholarship which spares you from working at McDonalds on provisional contracts for 4 years  Mr Hamon advocates phasing out diesel fuel and encouraging drivers to replace vehicles that use petroleum products with electrical ones His leftist pedigree began early His father worked at an arsenal in Brest a city in the far west of Brittany and his mother worked off and on as a secretary He was an early member of the Movement of Young Socialists and he has continued to work closely with them through his political life He also worked for Martine Aubry now the mayor of Lille and a former Socialist Party leader,0,paris france chose an idealistic traditional candidate in

9,9,A BackChannel Plan for Ukraine and Russia Courtesy of Trump Associates  The New York Times,Megan Twohey and Scott Shane,A week before Michael T Flynn resigned as national security adviser a sealed proposal was   to his office outlining a way for President Trump to lift sanctions against Russia Mr Flynn is gone having been caught lying about his own discussion of sanctions with the Russian ambassador But the proposal a peace plan for Ukraine and Russia remains along with those pushing it Michael D Cohen the presidents personal lawyer who delivered the document Felix H Sater a business associate who helped Mr Trump scout deals in Russia and a Ukrainian lawmaker trying to rise in a political opposition movement shaped in part by Mr Trumps former campaign manager Paul Manafort At a time when Mr Trumps ties to Russia and the people connected to him are under heightened scrutiny     with investigations by American intelligence agencies the F B I and Congress     some of his associates remain willing and eager to wade into   efforts behind the scenes Mr Trump has confounded Democrats and Republicans alike with his repeated praise for the Russian president Vladimir V Putin and his desire to forge an   alliance While there is nothing illegal about such unofficial efforts a proposal that seems to tip toward Russian interests may set off alarms The amateur diplomats say their goal is simply to help settle a grueling   conflict that has cost 10 000 lives Who doesnt want to help bring about peace Mr Cohen asked But the proposal contains more than just a peace plan Andrii V Artemenko the Ukrainian lawmaker who sees himself as a   leader of a future Ukraine claims to have evidence     names of companies wire transfers     showing corruption by the Ukrainian president Petro O Poroshenko that could help oust him And Mr Artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides to Mr Putin A lot of people will call me a Russian agent a U S agent a C I A agent Mr Artemenko said But how can you find a good solution between our countries if we do not talk Mr Cohen and Mr Sater said they had not spoken to Mr Trump about the proposal and have no experience in foreign policy Mr Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an F B I counterintelligence examination of links with Russia according to law enforcement officials he has denied any illicit connections The two others involved in the effort have somewhat questionable pasts Mr Sater 50 a   pleaded guilty to a role in a stock manipulation scheme decades ago that involved the Mafia Mr Artemenko spent two and a half years in jail in Kiev in the early 2000s on embezzlement charges later dropped which he said had been politically motivated While it is unclear if the White House will take the proposal seriously the diplomatic freelancing has infuriated Ukrainian officials Ukraines ambassador to the United States Valeriy Chaly said Mr Artemenko is not entitled to present any alternative peace plans on behalf of Ukraine to any foreign government including the U S administration  At a security conference in Munich on Friday Mr Poroshenko warned the West against appeasement of Russia and some American experts say offering Russia any alternative to a    international agreement on Ukraine would be a mistake The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about the conflict in Ukraine But given Mr Trumps praise for Mr Putin John Herbst a former American ambassador to Ukraine said he feared the new president might be too eager to mend relations with Russia at Ukraines expense     potentially with a plan like Mr Artemenkos It was late January when the three men associated with the proposed plan converged on the Loews Regency a luxury hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan where business deals are made in a lobby furnished with leather couches over martinis at the restaurant bar and in private conference rooms on upper floors Mr Cohen 50 lives two blocks up the street in Trump Park Avenue A lawyer who joined the Trump Organization in 2007 as special counsel he has worked on many deals including a   tower in the republic of Georgia and a   mixed martial arts venture starring a Russian fighter He is considered a loyal lieutenant whom Mr Trump trusts to fix difficult problems The F B I is reviewing an unverified dossier compiled by a former British intelligence agent and funded by Mr Trumps political opponents that claims Mr Cohen met with a Russian representative in Prague during the presidential campaign to discuss Russias hacking of Democratic targets But the Russian official named in the report told The New York Times that he had never met Mr Cohen Mr Cohen insists that he has never visited Prague and that the dossiers assertions are fabrications Mr Manafort is also under investigation by the F B I for his connections to Russia and Ukraine Mr Cohen has a personal connection to Ukraine He is married to a Ukrainian woman and once worked with relatives there to establish an ethanol business Mr Artemenko tall and burly arrived at the Manhattan hotel between visits to Washington His wife he said met the first lady Melania Trump years ago during their modeling careers but he did not try to meet Mr Trump He had attended the inauguration and visited Congress posting on Facebook his admiration for Mr Trump and talking up his peace plan in meetings with American lawmakers He entered Parliament in 2014 the year that the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych fled to Moscow amid protests over his economic alignment with Russia and corruption Mr Manafort who had been instrumental in getting Mr Yanukovych elected helped shape a political bloc that sprang up to oppose the new president Mr Poroshenko a wealthy businessman who has taken a far tougher stance toward Russia and accused Mr Putin of wanting to absorb Ukraine into a new Russian Empire Mr Artemenko 48 emerged from the opposition that Mr Manafort nurtured The two men have never met Mr Artemenko said Before entering politics Mr Artemenko had business ventures in the Middle East and real estate deals in the Miami area and had worked as an agent representing top Ukrainian athletes Some colleagues in Parliament describe him as corrupt untrustworthy or simply insignificant but he appears to have amassed considerable wealth He has fashioned himself in the image of Mr Trump presenting himself as Ukraines answer to a rising class of nationalist leaders in the West He even traveled to Cleveland last summer for the Republican National Convention seizing on the chance to meet with members of Mr Trumps campaign Its time for new leaders new approaches to the governance of the country new principles and new negotiators in international politics he wrote on Facebook on Jan 27 Our time has come Mr Artemenko said he saw in Mr Trump an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in Ukraine     and help advance his own political career Essentially his plan would require the withdrawal of all Russian forces from eastern Ukraine Ukrainian voters would decide in a referendum whether Crimea the Ukrainian territory seized by Russia in 2014 would be leased to Russia for a term of 50 or 100 years The Ukrainian ambassador Mr Chaly rejected a lease of that kind It is a gross violation of the Constitution he said in written answers to questions from The Times Such ideas can be pitched or pushed through only by those openly or covertly representing Russian interests  The reaction suggested why Mr Artemenkos project also includes the dissemination of kompromat or compromising material purportedly showing that Mr Poroshenko and his closest associates are corrupt Only a new government presumably one less hostile to Russia might take up his plan Mr Sater a longtime business associate of Mr Trumps with connections in Russia was willing to help Mr Artemenkos proposal reach the White House Mr Trump has sought to distance himself from Mr Sater in recent years If Mr Sater were sitting in the room right now Mr Trump said in a 2013 deposition I really wouldnt know what he looked like  But Mr Sater worked on real estate development deals with the Trump Organization on and off for at least a decade even after his role in the stock manipulation scheme came to light Mr Sater who was born in the Soviet Union and grew up in New York served as an executive at a firm called Bayrock Group two floors below the Trump Organization in Trump Tower and was later a senior adviser to Mr Trump He said he had been working on a plan for a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Russian real estate developer as recently as the fall of 2015 one that he said had come to a halt because of Mr Trumps presidential campaign Mr Cohen said the Trump Organization had received a letter of intent for a project in Moscow from a Russian real estate developer at that time but determined that the project was not feasible Mr Artemenko said a mutual friend had put him in touch with Mr Sater Helping to advance the proposal Mr Sater said made sense I want to stop a war number one he said Number two I absolutely believe that the U S and Russia need to be allies not enemies If I could achieve both in one stroke it would be a home run  After speaking with Mr Sater and Mr Artemenko in person Mr Cohen said he would deliver the plan to the White House Mr Cohen said he did not know who in the Russian government had offered encouragement on it as Mr Artemenko claims but he understood there was a promise of proof of corruption by the Ukrainian president Fraud is never good right Mr Cohen said He said Mr Sater had given him the written proposal in a sealed envelope When Mr Cohen met with Mr Trump in the Oval Office in early February he said he left the proposal in Mr Flynns office Mr Cohen said he was waiting for a response when Mr Flynn was forced from his post Now Mr Cohen Mr Sater and Mr Artemenko are hoping a new national security adviser will take up their cause On Friday the president wrote on Twitter that he had four new candidates for the job,0,a week before michael t flynn resigned as national security adviser a sealed proposal was to his office outlining a way for president trump to lift sanctions against russia mr flynn is gone having been caught lying about his own discussion of

felix h sater a business associate who helped mr trump scout deals in russia and a ukrainian lawmaker trying to rise in a political opposition movement shaped in part by mr trumps former campaign manager paul manafort at a time when mr trumps ties to russia and the people connected to him are under heightened scrutiny with investigations by american intelligence agencies the f b i and congress some of his associates remain willing and eager to wade into efforts behind the scenes mr trump has confounded democrats and republicans alike with his repeated praise for the russian president vladimir v putin and his desire to forge an alliance while there is nothing illegal about such unofficial efforts a proposal that seems to tip toward russian interests may set off alarms the amateur diplomats say their goal is simply to help settle a grueling conflict that has cost 10 000 lives who doesnt want to help bring about peace mr cohen asked but the proposal contains more than just a peace plan andrii v artemenko the ukrainian lawmaker who sees himself as a leader of a future ukraine claims to have evidence names of companies wire transfers showing corruption by the ukrainian president petro o poroshenko that could help oust him and mr artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides to mr putin a lot of people will call me a russian agent a u s agent a c i a agent mr artemenko said but how can you find a good solution between our countries if we do not talk mr cohen and mr sater said they had not spoken to mr trump about the proposal and have no experience in foreign policy mr cohen is one of several trump associates under scrutiny in an f b i counterintelligence examination of links with russia according to law enforcement officials he has denied any illicit connections the two others involved in the effort have somewhat questionable pasts mr sater 50 a pleaded guilty to a role in a stock manipulation scheme decades ago that involved the mafia mr artemenko spent two and a half years in jail in kiev in the early 2000s on embezzlement charges later dropped which he said had been politically motivated while it is unclear if the white house will take the proposal seriously the diplomatic freelancing has infuriated ukrainian officials ukraines ambassador to the united states valeriy chaly said mr artemenko is not entitled to present any alternative peace plans on behalf of ukraine to any foreign government including the u s administration at a security conference in munich on friday mr poroshenko warned the west against appeasement of russia and some american experts say offering russia any alternative to a international agreement on ukraine would be a mistake the trump administration has sent mixed signals about the conflict in ukraine but given mr trumps praise for mr putin john herbst a former american ambassador to ukraine said he feared the new president might be too eager to mend relations with russia at ukraines expense potentially with a plan like mr artemenkos it was late january when the three men associated with the proposed plan converged on the loews regency a luxury hotel on park avenue in manhattan where business deals are made in a lobby furnished with leather couches over martinis at the restaurant bar and in private conference rooms on upper floors mr cohen 50 lives two blocks up the street in trump park avenue a lawyer who joined the trump organization in 2007 as special counsel he has worked on many deals including a tower in the republic of georgia and a mixed martial arts venture starring a russian fighter he is considered a loyal lieutenant whom mr trump trusts to fix difficult problems the f b i is reviewing an unverified dossier compiled by a former british intelligence agent and funded by mr trumps political opponents that claims mr cohen met with a russian representative in prague during the presidential campaign to discuss russias hacking of democratic targets but the russian official named in the report told the new york times that he had never met mr cohen mr cohen insists that he has never visited prague and that the dossiers assertions are fabrications mr manafort is also under investigation by the f b i for his connections to russia and ukraine mr cohen has a personal connection to ukraine he is married to a ukrainian woman and once worked with relatives there to establish an ethanol business mr artemenko tall and burly arrived at the manhattan hotel between visits to washington his wife he said met the first lady melania trump years ago during their modeling careers but he did not try to meet mr trump he had attended the inauguration and visited congress posting on facebook his admiration for mr trump and talking up his peace plan in meetings with american lawmakers he entered parliament in 2014 the year that the former ukrainian president viktor yanukovych fled to moscow amid protests over his economic alignment with russia and corruption mr manafort who had been instrumental in getting mr yanukovych elected helped shape a political bloc that sprang up to oppose the new president mr poroshenko a wealthy businessman who has taken a far tougher stance toward russia and accused mr putin of wanting to absorb ukraine into a new russian empire mr artemenko 48 emerged from the opposition that mr manafort nurtured the two men have never met mr artemenko said before entering politics mr artemenko had business ventures in the middle east and real estate deals in the miami area and had worked as an agent representing top ukrainian athletes some colleagues in parliament describe him as corrupt untrustworthy or simply insignificant but he appears to have amassed considerable wealth he has fashioned himself in the image of mr trump presenting himself as ukraines answer to a rising class of nationalist leaders in the west he even traveled to cleveland last summer for the republican national convention seizing on the chance to meet with members of mr trumps campaign its time for new leaders new approaches to the governance of the country new principles and new negotiators in international politics he wrote on facebook on jan 27 our time has come mr artemenko said he saw in mr trump an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in ukraine and help advance his own political career essentially his plan would require the withdrawal of all russian forces from eastern ukraine ukrainian voters would decide in a referendum whether crimea the ukrainian territory seized by russia in 2014 would be leased to russia for a term of 50 or 100 years the ukrainian ambassador mr chaly rejected a lease of that kind it is a gross violation of the constitution he said in written answers to questions from the times such ideas can be pitched or pushed through only by those openly or covertly representing russian interests the reaction suggested why mr artemenkos project also includes the dissemination of kompromat or compromising material purportedly showing that mr poroshenko and his closest associates are corrupt only a new government presumably one less hostile to russia might take up his plan mr sater a longtime business associate of mr trumps with connections in russia was willing to help mr artemenkos proposal reach the white house mr trump has sought to distance himself from mr sater in recent years if mr sater were sitting in the room right now mr trump said in a 2013 deposition i really wouldnt know what he looked like but mr sater worked on real estate development deals with the trump organization on and off for at least a decade even after his role in the stock manipulation scheme came to light mr sater who was born in the soviet union and grew up in new york served as an executive at a firm called bayrock group two floors below the trump organization in trump tower and was later a senior adviser to mr trump he said he had been working on a plan for a trump tower in moscow with a russian real estate developer as recently as the fall of 2015 one that he said had come to a halt because of mr trumps presidential campaign mr cohen said the trump organization had received a letter of intent for a project in moscow from a russian real estate developer at that time but determined that the project was not feasible mr artemenko said a mutual friend had put him in touch with mr sater helping to advance the proposal mr sater said made sense i want to stop a war number one he said number two i absolutely believe that the u s and russia need to be allies not enemies if i could achieve both in one stroke it would be a home run after speaking with mr sater and mr artemenko in person mr cohen said he would deliver the plan to the white house mr cohen said he did not know who in the russian government had offered encouragement on it as mr artemenko claims but he understood there was a promise of proof of corruption by the ukrainian president fraud is never good right mr cohen said he said mr sater had given him the written proposal in a sealed envelope when mr cohen met with mr trump in the oval office in early february he said he left the proposal in mr flynns office mr cohen said he was waiting for a response when mr flynn was forced from his post now mr cohen mr sater and mr artemenko are hoping a new

leaders are openly associated with groups financed by billionaire George Soros  Politico earlier this month profiled Indivisible in an article titled Inside the protest movement that has Republicans

Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire as Breitbart News documented Organizing for Action OFA is a   community organizing project that sprung from Obamas 2012 campaign organization Organizing for America becoming a nonprofit described by the Washington Post as advocateing for the presidents policies  In a recent Facebook post titled Take a deep breath Then take action OFA called on constituents to lobby particularly hard between now and February 26 when lawmakers will be in their home districts The post included a link to a guide released by Indivisible on how to organize against Trump Stay tuned for online trainings and invitations to calls with coalition partners like Indivisible Guide the OFA post states Paul Sperry writing at the New York Post relates The manual published with OFA partner Indivisible advises protesters to go into halls quietly so as not to raise alarms and grab seats at the front of the room but do not all sit together  Rather spread out in pairs to make it seem like the whole room opposes the Republican hosts positions This will help reinforce the impression of broad consensus  It also urges them to ask hostile questions     while keeping a firm hold on the mic     and loudly boo the the GOP politician if he isnt giving you real answers  Express your concern to the events hosts they are giving a platform to   authoritarianism racism and corruption it says       Even the safest Republican will be deeply alarmed by signs of organized opposition the document states because these actions create the impression that theyre not connected to their district and not listening to their constituents  Sperry reported OFA plans to stage 400 rallies across 42 states this year to attack Trump and Republicans over ObamaCares repeal  Earlier this month NBC News reported on OFAs new actions and its partnership with Indivisible OFA has hired 14 field organizers in states home to key senators as part of its campaign to defend Obamas signature healthcare law To run that campaign the group hired Saumya Narechania     the former national field director at Enroll America which worked to sign people up for Obamacare     and a deputy campaign manager       OFA says more than 1 800 people have applied to its Spring Community Engagement Fellowship a   training program   of whom have not previously been involved with OFA And the group has teamed up with Indivisible a buzzy newcomer to the progressive movement to offer organizing training that began Thursday night with a video conference A combined 25

consultant at the radical National Council of La Raza Soros is a major La Raza donor Politico went on to detail how Indivisible has been aided by MoveOn org and the ACLU  The news website failed to

12,12,Russian Researchers Discover Secret Nazi Military Base Treasure Hunter in the Arctic Photos,Amando Flavio,"The mystery surrounding The Third Reich and Nazi Germany is still a subject of debate between many observers Some believe that Nazi Germany under the control of Adolf Hitler possessed supernatural powers and largely employed pseudoscience during the 19331945 period However some also hold that the above belief is just a mere speculation without any proven fact Over the years researchers have searched extensively for answers to some of the more mysterious activities associated with Nazi Germany
Nazi Germany invaded Russia formerly the USSR during the Second World War on June 22 1941 At the time the German army progressed deep into Russian territory gaining ground close to the capital Moscow before the Russians could counterattack eventually driving the Nazis back
During the Nazi occupation in Russia in 1942 the Nazis built a secret military base around the Arctic codenamed Schatzgraber or Treasure Hunter which was reportedly very instrumental in the war against Russia The base was primarily used as a tactical weather station for planning the strategic movements of Nazi troops warships and submarines The base also housed eminent Nazi scientists whom conducted many experiments to help progress a German win of the war It was widely speculated at the time that the Nazis used the base to contact aliens or extraterrestrial beings The controversial Ahnenerbe was even linked to the base The Ahnenerbe was an institute in Nazi Germany Responsible for researching archaeological and cultural history of the Aryan race it is rumored to have had heavy occult influences Founded on July 1 1935 by Heinrich Himmler Herman Wirth and Richard Walther Darré the Ahnenerbe later conducted experiments and launched expeditions in attempts to prove that mythological Nordic populations had once ruled the world
However the Nazis abandoned the base in 1944  a time when the Russian army began its offensive pushing the Germans out of the country According to a wartime story supplies had dwindled to dangerously low levels and the Nazi officers stationed at the base outpost were forced to kill and eat polar bear which ultimately was infected with trichinosis This caused those stationed at the base to fall severely ill and eventually they required rescue by a German Uboat Despite Russian authors telling the story of Treasure Hunter some observers consider it a myth doubting its existence
But Russian researchers have now announced that Treasure Hunter has been discovered saying the base is on the island of Alexandra Land in the Arctic Circle located 620 miles from the North Pole

15,15,In Major League Soccer Argentines Find a Home and Success  The New York Times,Jack Williams,Guillermo Barros Schelotto was not the first Argentine player to set foot on a Major League Soccer field Statistically speaking he was the 28th when he made his debut for the Columbus Crew in 2007 But Schelottos phone still rings to this day more than six years after he left the league with calls from fellow Argentines looking for advice Though Schelotto 43 is currently the coach of Boca Juniors the most decorated team in Argentina most of the players who call him want to talk about other teams about other countries about a soccer world away from the   environment of Buenos Aires Most of them like to talk about the cities Schelotto said Many of them find a way to come Argentines now make up the   demographic in M L S trailing only Americans According to the Elias Sports Bureau going into this seasons openers 98 Argentine players had been featured in an M L S   game since the leagues inception Sebastian Blanco a new designated player for Portland made his debut in an opener Friday and became No 99 In a ranking by nationality Argentines have the   goal total too Twelve of the 22 teams in M L S will start the season with at least one Argentine on their roster a list that includes stars like Dallass Mauro Diaz and Montreals Ignacio Piatti and newcomers like Atlantas Hector Villalba and New York City F Cs Maxi Moralez Why do they come For some its the money or at least the promise that it will be paid regularly Others come for the lifestyle the chance to fade into a comparative anonymity unavailable to them at home or to live the quiet clean life that Schelotto describes as he reminisces about his days in Ohio The Portland Timbers playmaker Diego Valeri was one such player who called Schelotto his former manager and he eventually heeded his advice But he said it was for an entirely different reason A year before he signed with Portland while under contract to his hometown club Lanus Valeri had had a gun pressed to his throat when robbers attempted to steal his BMW with his wife Florencia and daughter Connie inside After that moment Valeri said with considerable understatement we thought about opportunities to play outside and know different places in the world  Within a year Valeri who had had loan spells in Portugal and Spain was on his way to Portland Situations like that are very hard for the Argentinian people to change he said The    Valeri and his family are now settled in the Northwest where he is playing arguably the best soccer of his career He is a     and in between was named the most valuable player when Portland won the 2015 M L S Cup championship game I think they like the anonymity and the tranquillity here Caleb Porter Valeris coach with the Timbers said of his star and his countrymen They really relish the opportunity to be here and to live a lifestyle thats different to how they lived in Argentina They transition well into M L S  Since 2011 Portland has signed six Argentines including its   acquisition of Blanco 28 Valeri has been a good ambassador     he speaks English and urges newcomers to try to learn it as soon as possible to ease the transition But Porter and the Timbers general manager and president of soccer Gavin Wilkinson believe there is another more straightforward reason for Argentinas outsize presence in M L S It simply produces the kind of technical player that the league desires Certain countries produce certain positions more Porter said Most teams are looking for that creative piece and you know you can get one in Argentina  A large alumni directory and strong ties to agents and consultants in the region have made that kind of shopping easier for M L S teams and in the past the struggles of the Argentine economy also favored North American clubs some said But there also has been a change in the kind of individual looking to make the move north and that has dovetailed with the leagues overall transfer policy As the quality of M L S has improved as it enters its third decade its teams have looked less for marketability from its imports     which in the past had trended toward aging often European stars     and more toward onfield impact and value The latest class of Argentines reflects this shift as they enter a league where the average age of designated players     the teams   stars     has fallen below 28 its lowest point in a decade They know that M L S is different to 10 years ago said Schelotto who was 34 when he moved to the league They can go make good money play with some pressure They know they can make a career in the United States and then maybe move to Europe Ten years ago it was impossible Right now you can  There are currently 24 Argentines playing in the league Atlanta United and its Argentine coach Tata Martino brought in three ahead of its first season each of them 25 or younger Villalba is just 22 Buying young is now seen as more of a benefit to clubs than a risk as players who continue to develop retain a   value if they move on to brighter prospects in Europe People are coming here younger and younger maybe to start their careers Ignacio Piatti a    playmaker for the Montreal Impact said through an interpreter Its what they are looking for at that age being able to live a comfortable life off the field and focus on their games  Piatti like Schelotto has been happy to offer advice to the next wave of Argentine talents considering entering M L S including players on both sides of the Hudson River Gonzalo Veron 27 of the Red Bulls and Moralez 30 who recently signed with New York City F C both acknowledged that they had turned to Piatti for advice before signing At a community event in East Harlem last week Moralez     who spent four years in Italy     reflected on his decision to move to the United States He had never been to New York City before signing he said and after turning to the likes of Piatti and David Villa for advice about the leagues standard of play he said he also sought assurances for his family who are set to join him in New York shortly First off I just want to enjoy football

16,16,Wells Fargo Chief Abruptly Steps Down  The New York Times,Michael Corkery and Stacy Cowley,The scandal engulfing Wells Fargo toppled its chairman and chief executive on Wednesday as John G Stumpf announced his departure from the company effective immediately The move was a swift and stunning fall for an executive whose bank made it through the 2008 financial crisis relatively unscathed only to be undone by a   sales scandal that pervaded its community banking division and percolated under the surface for years It was an extraordinary moment even in the banking industry which has been bedeviled by criticism and regular scandals since the financial crisis Despite the industrys many troubles relatively few banking chiefs have stepped down under outside pressure But Wells Fargos transgressions were unusually blatant and straightforward which contributed to the   public outcry This time there were no exotic financial instruments complicated trades or complex mortgage trickery The banks misdeeds were fundamentally simple Under intense pressure to meet aggressive sales goals employees created sham accounts using the names     and sometimes the actual money     of the banks real customers And in some cases the customers did not discover the activity until they started accumulating fees The reaction to the fake accounts at Wells Fargo and to Mr Stumpfs response to what has been uncovered as a widespread problem has been withering and unrelenting Wells Fargo has been under fire from irate customers regulators lawmakers and former employees since last month when it disclosed that it would pay 185 million in fines and penalties over the unauthorized creation of as many as two million bank and credit card accounts over a period of at least five years by branch employees who were said to be under intense pressure to hit ambitious product sales goals The sales practices may reach back far longer Former bank employees told The New York Times of concerns they raised internally as far back as 11 years ago Mr Stumpf 63 who was twice called in front of Congress to testify about the scandal in recent weeks faced vocal demands to resign from an outraged public but the timing of his departure was unexpected given that the Wells Fargo board had not completed its internal investigation into the phony accounts and that the bank reports   earnings on Friday He potentially walks away with millions of dollars including a 20 million pension as of Wednesday another 4 3 million in deferred compensation plus stock worth 109 million according to data from Equilar As the scandal erupted Mr Stumpf who grew up on a dairy and poultry farm in Minnesota and had long emphasized his folksy roots was unable to quell the uproar Rather he often seemed to inflame it During his testimony in front of Congress Mr Stumpf said he took responsibility for the problems but would not admit that there anything wrong with the banks broader culture When pressed repeatedly by members of the Senate Banking Committee about why he had not given back any of his lavish compensation Mr Stumpf insisted that the decision was not up to him but to the banks board He was reminded that he was the boards chairman One senator on the banking committee noted that criticism of the Wells Fargo scandal was one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans had agreed on in a long time Mr Stumpfs spent 34 years at a bank that had once been regarded as a darling on Wall Street because of its ability to churn out profits even as other banks struggled Mr Stumpf was named chief executive in 2007 and was one of the countrys   bankers earning about 19 million last year He was named the 2013 Banker of the Year by the trade publication American Banker Wells Fargo was once the most valuable bank as measured by the price of its stock which attracted the billionaire Warren E Buffett as its largest shareholder Mr Buffetts company Berkshire Hathaway has a stake of about 10 percent Mr Buffett did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday Wells Fargo has since ceded the most valuable bank distinction to JPMorgan Chase The board received a letter from Mr Stumpf early on Wednesday indicating that he intended to retire according to a person briefed on the matter This person said the board was still in the early stages of conducting its investigation into the fake accounts and Mr Stumpfs handling of the scandal and had not drawn any conclusions from its inquiry The board was not scheduled to meet on Wednesday when it received Mr Stumpfs letter which this person described as brief and lacking any indication as to why the longtime C E O decided to leave now Top bank executives were expecting that Mr Stumpf would address analysts and investors     as he has always done     when Wells Fargo reports its   results on Friday Wells Fargo said Mr Stumpf would be replaced by Timothy J Sloan its president and chief operating officer Just two days earlier the San Francisco bank shuffled its top management to give more responsibility to Mr Sloan I am grateful for the opportunity to have led Wells Fargo Mr Stumpf said in a written statement While I have been deeply committed and focused on managing the company through this period I have decided it is best for the company that I step aside  Mr Sloan was informed early Wednesday that he was the banks new C E O though he had known for several days that Mr Stumpf was preparing to step down In an interview Mr Sloan said Mr Stumpf had told him of his decision to retire after concluding that he would most likely continue to be the focus of much of the criticism being leveled at the bank It was an incredibly selfless decision Mr Sloan said Federal regulators and the Los Angeles city attorney began looking into the issue in 2013 The deal Wells Fargo announced last month to settle cases brought by their offices was intended to resolve the matter but it instead opened the floodgates provoking a furious outpouring of questions criticism and new information about what former employees say was a   culture of toxic sales pressure The Department of Justice and Labor Department opened their own inquiries Mr Sloan said the bank had already named a new head of community banking ended the retail banking sales goals that employees blamed for putting them under undue pressure and extended its review of its sales practices back to 2009 Originally the banks review covered its activities only between 2011 and 2015 Mr Sloan will not hold the dual of roles of chief executive and chairman as Mr Stump had Mr Stumpf agreed last month to surrender stock grants valued at 41 million     another highly unusual move on Wall Street where clawback provisions have been widely adopted but are almost never deployed Mr Stumpf said he would give up his 2 8 million annual salary for the duration of the boards investigation Because his departure is a resignation Mr Stumpf will leave without any severance according to Oscar Suris a company spokesman Senator Elizabeth Warren the Massachusetts Democrat who blasted Mr Stumpf when he appeared before the Senate last month fired off a scathing statement on Wednesday As I said at the hearing last month Mr Stumpf should resign return every nickel he made while this scam was going on and face an investigation by the Justice Department and S E C  she said So far hes one for three ,0,the scandal engulfing wells fargo toppled its chairman and chief executive on wednesday as john g stumpf announced his departure from the company effective immediately the move was a swift and stunning fall for an executive whose bank made it through the 2008 financial crisis relatively unscathed only to be undone by a sales scandal that pervaded its community banking division and percolated under the surface for years it was an extraordinary moment even in the banking industry which has been bedeviled by criticism and regular scandals since the financial crisis despite the industrys many troubles relatively few banking chiefs have stepped down under outside pressure but wells fargos transgressions were unusually blatant and straightforward which contributed to the public outcry this time there were no exotic financial instruments complicated trades or complex mortgage trickery the banks misdeeds were fundamentally simple under intense pressure to meet aggressive sales goals employees created sham accounts using the names and sometimes the actual money of the banks real customers and in some cases the customers did not discover the activity until they started accumulating fees the reaction to the fake accounts at wells fargo and to mr stumpfs response to what has been uncovered as a widespread problem has been withering and unrelenting wells fargo has been under fire from irate customers regulators lawmakers and former employees since last month when it disclosed that it would pay 185 million in fines and penalties over the unauthorized creation of as many as two million bank and credit card accounts over a period of at least five years by branch employees who were said to be under intense pressure to hit ambitious product sales goals the sales practices may reach back far longer former bank employees told the new york times of concerns they raised internally as far back as 11 years ago mr stumpf 63 who was twice called in front of congress to testify about the scandal in recent weeks faced vocal demands to resign from an outraged public but the timing of his departure was unexpected given that the wells fargo board had not completed its internal investigation into the phony accounts and that the bank reports earnings on friday he potentially walks away with millions of dollars including a 20 million pension as of wednesday another 4 3 million in deferred compensation plus stock worth 109 million according to data from equilar as the scandal erupted mr stumpf who grew up on a dairy and poultry farm in minnesota and had long emphasized his folksy roots was unable to quell the uproar rather he often seemed to inflame it during his testimony in front of congress mr stumpf said he took responsibility for the problems but would not admit that there anything wrong with the banks broader culture when pressed repeatedly by members of the senate banking committee about why he had not given back any of his lavish compensation mr stumpf insisted that the decision was not up to him but to the banks board he was reminded that he was the boards chairman one senator on the banking

24,24,Abortion Pill Orders Rise in 7 Latin American Nations on Zika Alert  The New York Times,Donald G McNeil Jr and Pam Belluck,Orders for abortion pills by women in seven Latin American countries with Zika outbreaks increased after health officials in those countries warned that the virus might cause severe birth defects according to a womens organization supplying such pills Orders from women in Brazil Ecuador and Venezuela roughly doubled while those from Colombia Costa Rica El Salvador and Honduras went up by from 36 percent to 76 percent researchers said in a study published Wednesday by The New England Journal of Medicine The authors of the study included a leader of the group based in Amsterdam that is supplying the pills Women on Web a nonprofit staffed by doctors helping women from countries where abortion is illegal or restricted to terminate unwanted pregnancies Even with the increase in demand for abortion pills the number of orders received by Women on Web from Latin America and the Caribbean in that time period was small slightly more than 2 300 in the region with about 1 600 of those in countries where health authorities had warned about Zikas potential to cause brain damage In the countries where Zika warnings were issued there are typically about 3 5 million abortions per year said Gilda Sedgh the principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute a reproductive health research organization which was not involved in the study So Dr Sedgh said The increase in demand for abortion observed by the authors in countries affected by Zika could be spurious because Women on Web accounts for a small share of all abortions in that part of the world  The numbers could be an early warning sign of increased demand for abortion because of Zika Dr Sedgh said adding that it is also possible that Women on Web might have experienced an increase in demand as a result of increased visibility of their services when health advisories were issued  Access to abortion has been a contentious issue for years in many of the countries affected by Zika but Zika has brought fresh attention to the debate In Latin America and the Caribbean according to a recent study there are about 6 5 million abortions each year Most of them are illegal and an estimated 750 000 women a year are treated for complications from unsafe abortions in the region Dr Sedgh said Womens rights groups have long pressed for abortion restrictions to be eased The study looked at orders for pills between Nov 17 2015 when the Pan American Health Organization issued an alert saying Zika virus might be linked to a surge in infants born with tiny heads and damaged brains in Brazil and March 2 of this year It compared actual orders to the number that would have been expected based on orders during the previous five years Women on Web has a history of defying legal restrictions in such countries which sometimes block access to its website or seize the packages it sends The nonprofit also asks women unable to pay for their prescription to write an email explaining why they needed the abortion pill and could not afford it Some of the emails that came in were heartbreaking said Dr Abigail R A Aiken a reproductive health researcher at the Lyndon B Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas Austin and the lead author of the study The fear and desperation was really hard to read  A woman from Venezuela wrote I contracted Zika 4 days ago adding I love children But I dont believe it is a wise decision to keep a baby who will suffer I need an abortion I dont know who to turn to Please help me ASAP An email from a woman in Colombia said Here Zika is a major problem and the health authorities do not help with it  She added I have no resources at this time and want to ask for your help because fear overwhelms me What if the baby is born sick  Even more than it has increased attention on restrictive abortion laws the Zika crisis has highlighted the issues of access to contraception and ways that women are   about birth control or discouraged from using it in some of the countries In the face of Zika some countries have been working to increase the availability and use of contraception Women on Web is an offshoot of Women on Waves which was founded in 1999 by Dr Rebecca Gomperts Women on Waves originally sailed a Dutch boat to countries that

25,25,Nukes and the UN a Historic Treaty to Ban Nuclear Weapons,Ira Helfand,"Email 
In an historic move the United Nations First Committee voted Thursday to convene a conference next March to negotiate a new treaty to ban the possession of nuclear weapons The vote is a huge step forward in the campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons launched several years ago by nonnuclear weapons states and civil society from across the globe 
Dismayed by the failure of the nuclear weapons states to honor their obligation under Article VI of the Non Proliferation Treaty which requires them to pursue good faith negotiations for the elimination of their nuclear arsenals and moved by the growing danger of nuclear war more than 120 nations gathered in Oslo in March of 2013 to review the latest scientific data about the catastrophic consequences that will result from the use of nuclear weapons The conference shifted the focus of international discussion about nuclear war from abstract consideration of nuclear strategy to an evaluation of the medical data about what will actually happen if these weapons are used It was boycotted by all of the major nuclear powers the US Russia UK China and France the five permanent members of the UN Security Council or P5 
Further meetings in Nayarit Mexico and Vienna followed in 2014 and culminated in a pledge by the Austrian government to close the gap in international law that does not yet specifically outlaw the possession of these weapons More than 140 countries ultimately associated themselves with the pledge which was fiercely opposed by the United States and the other nuclear weapons states and in the fall of 2015 the UN General Assembly voted to establish an Open Ended Working Group which met in Geneva earlier this year and recommended the negotiations approved Thursday 
The United States which led the opposition had hoped to limit the Yes vote to less than one hundred but failed badly The final vote was 123 For 38 Against and 16 Abstentions The No votes came from the nuclear weapons states and US allies in NATO plus Japan South Korea and Australia which have treaty ties to the US and consider themselves to be under the protection of the US nuclear umbrella 
But four nuclear weapons states broke ranks with China India and Pakistan abstaining and North Korea voting in favor of the treaty negotiations In addition the Netherlands defied intense pressure from the rest of NATO and abstained as did Finland which is not a member of NATO but has close ties with the alliance 
Japan which voted with the US against the treaty has indicated that it will nonetheless participate in the negotiations when they begin in March 
The US and the other nuclear weapons states will probably try to block final approval of the treaty conference by the General Assembly later this fall but following Thursdays vote it appears overwhelmingly likely that negotiations will begin in March and that they will involve a significant majority of UN member states even if the nuclear states continue their boycott 
The successful completion of a new treaty will not of itself eliminate nuclear weapons But it will put powerful new pressure on the nuclear weapons states who clearly do not want to uphold their obligations under the Non Proliferation Treaty even as they insist that the nonnuclear weapons states meet theirs 
We have come perilously close to nuclear war on multiple occasions during the last 70 years and we have been incredibly lucky US nuclear policy cannot continue to be the hope that we will remain lucky in the future We need to join and lead the growing movement to abolish nuclear weapons and work to bring the other nuclear weapons states into a binding agreement that sets out the detailed time line for eliminating these weapons and the detailed verification and enforcement mechanisms to make sure they are eliminated 
This will not be an easy task but we really have no choice If we dont get rid of these weapons someday perhaps sooner rather than later they will be used and they will destroy human civilization The decision is ours

than one hundred but failed badly the final vote was 123 for 38 against and 16 abstentions the no votes came from the nuclear weapons states and us allies in nato plus japan south korea and australia which have treaty ties to the us and consider themselves to be under the protection of the us nuclear umbrella but four nuclear weapons states broke ranks with china india and pakistan abstaining and north korea voting in favor of the treaty negotiations in addition the netherlands defied intense pressure from the rest of nato and abstained as did finland which is not a member of nato but has close ties with the alliance japan which voted with the us against the treaty has indicated that it will nonetheless participate in the negotiations when they begin in march the us and the other nuclear weapons states will probably try to block final approval of the treaty conference by the general assembly later this fall but following thursdays vote it appears overwhelmingly likely that negotiations will begin in march and that they will involve a significant majority of un member states even if the nuclear states continue their boycott the successful completion of a new treaty will not of itself eliminate nuclear weapons but it will put powerful new pressure on the nuclear weapons states who clearly do not want to uphold their obligations under the non proliferation treaty even as they insist that the nonnuclear weapons states meet theirs we have come perilously close to nuclear war on multiple occasions during the last 70 years and we have been incredibly lucky us nuclear policy can not continue to be the hope that we will remain lucky in the future we need to join and lead the growing movement to abolish nuclear weapons and work to bring the other nuclear weapons states into a binding agreement that sets out the detailed time line for eliminating these weapons and the detailed verification and enforcement mechanisms to make sure they are eliminated this will not be an easy task but we really have no choice if we dont get rid of these weapons someday perhaps sooner rather than later they will be used and they will destroy human civilization the decision is

27,27,Humiliated Hillary Tries To Hide What Camera Caught 15 Mins Before Rally,Amanda Shea,"Humiliated Hillary Tries To Hide What Camera Caught 15 Mins Before Rally Posted on October 27 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Hillary Clinton outside rally left Fox News catching incident on live feed right 
Both presidential candidates stopped in the battleground state of Florida this week to campaign for votes to crowds at separate locations However things didnt go so well for Hillary Clinton who was humiliated when a camera caught what she immediately tried to hide to save her campaign  which backfired big time 
While Donald Trumps 15000person army of Deplorables were holding down the fort in Stanford Florida as they listened to this great leader explain how he plans to make America great again Hillary was at a much smaller venue at Palm Beach State College Although she was feeling pretty good about herself with having a higher turnout than shes used to the approximate 1000 to 2000 attendees paled in comparison to what Trump was looking at in the same state However Hillarys anemic crowd was enough to be publicly mocked in front of 
Perhaps Hillary didnt think anyone would notice but Fox Business Network was watching  and commenting  live With just fifteen minutes before the Democratic candidate was set to take the stage in one of her final and most important rallies the small room should have been jampacked with people As the humored hosts noted on the news show that was far from the case 
Here it is nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in Sanford Florida yesterday for Mr Trump 15000 Theres maybe a thousand to two thousand people here today one host pointed out much to Hillarys embarrassment The Clinton rallies tend to be much smaller and you can see theres empty space here and shes supposed to speak in 15 minutes And I can tell you that as the camera pans across that if we were at a Trump rally this would absolutely be packed the commentators added 
No matter how far ahead in the polls Hillary and her lapdog media says she is the attendance at her events speaks volumes Nobody cares or is enthusiastic enough about this woman to bother showing up and those who do have to be coached on how to chant and act excited 
On the other hand there are Trumps rallies where so many people turn up to venues four times the size as Hillarys that these massive stadiums cant contain everyone who is eager to come and some are turned away If the turnout at the rallies is any indicator of whats expected at the polls Hillary cant win and if she does Americans should definitely question how that could even happen",1,humiliated hillary tries to hide what camera caught 15 mins before rally posted on october 27 2016 by amanda shea in politics share this hillary clinton outside rally left fox news catching incident on live feed right both presidential candidates stopped in the battleground state of florida this week to campaign for votes to crowds at separate locations however things didnt go so well for hillary clinton who was humiliated when a camera caught what she immediately tried to hide to save her campaign which backfired big time while donald trumps 15000person army of deplorables were holding down the fort in stanford florida as they listened to this great leader explain how he plans to make america great again hillary was at a much smaller venue at palm beach state college although she was feeling pretty good about herself with having a higher turnout than shes used to the approximate 1000 to 2000 attendees paled in comparison to what trump was looking at in the same state however hillarys anemic crowd was enough to be publicly mocked in front of perhaps hillary didnt think anyone would notice but fox business network was watching and commenting live with just fifteen minutes before the democratic candidate was set to take the stage in one of her final and most important rallies the small room should have been jampacked with people as the humored hosts noted on the news show that was far from the case here it is nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in sanford florida yesterday for mr trump 15000 theres maybe a thousand to two thousand people here today one host pointed out much to hillarys embarrassment the clinton rallies tend to be much smaller and you can see theres empty space here and shes supposed to speak in 15 minutes and i can tell you that as the camera pans across that if we were at a trump rally this would absolutely be packed the commentators added no matter how far ahead in the polls hillary and her lapdog media says she is the attendance at her events speaks volumes nobody cares or is enthusiastic enough about this woman to bother showing up and those who do have to be coached on how to chant and act excited on the other hand there are trumps rallies where so many people turn up to venues four times the size as hillarys that these massive stadiums cant contain everyone who is eager to come and some are turned away if the turnout at the rallies is any indicator of whats expected at the polls hillary cant win and if she does americans should definitely question how that could even happen ,humiliated hillary tries to hide what camera caught 15 mins before rally ,amanda shea ,humiliated hillary tries hide camera caught 15 mins rally posted october 27 2016 amanda shea politics share hillary clinton outside rally left fox news catching incident live feed right presidential candidates stopped battleground state florida week campaign votes crowds separate locations however things didnt go well hillary clinton humiliated camera caught immediately tried hide save campaign backfired big time donald trumps 15000person army deplorables holding fort stanford florida listened great leader explain plans make america great hillary much smaller venue palm beach state college although feeling pretty good higher turnout shes used approximate 1000 2000 attendees paled comparison trump looking state however hillarys anemic crowd enough publicly mocked front perhaps hillary didnt think anyone would notice fox business network watching commenting live fifteen minutes democratic candidate set take stage one final important rallies small room jampacked people humored hosts noted news show far case nowhere near size crowd saw sanford florida yesterday mr trump 15000 theres maybe thousand two thousand people today one host pointed much hillarys embarrassment clinton rallies tend much smaller see theres empty space shes supposed speak 15 minutes tell camera pans across trump rally would absolutely packed commentators added matter far ahead polls hillary lapdog media says attendance events speaks volumes nobody cares enthusiastic enough woman bother showing coached chant act excited hand trumps rallies many people turn venues four times size hillarys massive stadiums cant contain everyone eager come turned away turnout rallies indicator whats expected polls hillary cant win americans definitely question could even happen ,humiliated hillary tries hide camera caught 15 mins rally ,amanda shea 
28,28,Andrea Tantaros of Fox News Claims Retaliation for Sex Harassment Complaints  The New York Times,Jim Dwyer,Andrea Tantaros a former Fox News host charged in a lawsuit filed Monday that top executives at the network including the man who replaced Roger Ailes punished her for complaining about sexual harassment by Mr Ailes The suit by Ms Tantaros filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan is the latest round in a contentious volley that began in late winter when Fox claimed she had breached her employment contract by writing a book without receiving network approval Fox News masquerades as a defender of traditional family values but behind the scenes it operates like a   Playboy   cult steeped in intimidation indecency and misogyny Ms Tantaross suit says Fox News said it would not comment on pending litigation Mr Ailes the networks founding chairman and guiding force for two decades resigned last month after a former anchor Gretchen Carlson said in a suit that she was fired for refusing his sexual advances Mr Ailes has denied all allegations of harassment In April the chief lawyer for Fox charged that Ms Tantaros had concocted sexual harassment claims to gain leverage in the contract dispute her lawyer Judd Burstein said the book dispute was a pretext that Fox was using to silence her During arbitration Mr Burstein said Fox News offered to pay her a sum in the seven figures if she renounced claims against Mr Ailes and others at the network including the host Bill OReilly According to the lawsuit Ms Tantaros said she had been subjected to unwelcome advances from Mr OReilly whom she had regarded as a friend and adviser Ailes did not act alone the lawsuit states He may have been the primary culprit but his actions were condoned by his most senior lieutenants who engaged in a concerted effort to silence Tantaros by threats humiliation and retaliation  Ms Tantaros also claimed in the lawsuit that she was the subject of humiliating posts by pseudonymous accounts on Twitter known as sock puppets that she says were instigated by the Fox News publicity department Ms Tantaros joined Fox as a contributor in 2010 and a year later was named   of The Five which aired at 5 p m She said in the suit that she was repeatedly told by Fox executives that she could not wear pants on the air because Roger wants to see your legs  The lawsuit goes on to say that on Aug 12 2014 Mr Ailes called her into his office and asked if she was planning to marry and have children Ailes then started complaining about marriage in general and also made   jokes about being married the lawsuit states It describes Mr Ailes as speculating on the sexual habits and preferences of 10 Fox News personalities He asked Ms Tantaros to turn around so I can get a good look at you the lawsuit charges adding that Ms Tantaros refused Soon after she was moved from The Five to a   show Outnumbered that aired at midday Mr Ailes called her back for similar sessions in December 2014 and February 2015 the lawsuit charges and when she continued to rebuff him she encountered hostility from the Fox News publicity department In the February meeting she said Mr Ailes talked about how she would look in a bikini and accused her of ending a   relationship because she had been merely using the man The episode brought her to tears the lawsuit states She said the sole interview arranged by the publicity department during that period was with a writer for a blog controlled by Fox who asked about her breasts and if she was difficult to work with In April 2015 the lawsuit states Ms Tantaros met with Bill Shine then a senior news executive and close aide to Mr Ailes She said that she told him about the meetings with Mr Ailes and asked if he had told the head of publicity for Fox News Irena Briganti to go after her The lawsuit claims that Mr Shine told Tantaros that Briganti is like a rabid dog on a chain that we cant control Sometimes that dog gets off the chain  Then pointing to a picture of Mr Ailes on a magazine cover the lawsuit charges Mr Shine told her that this powerful man has faith in Irena Briganti and that Ms Tantaros needs to let this one go

32,32,Having Won Boris Johnson and Brexit Leaders Fumble  The New York Times,Steven Erlanger,LONDON     With their giddy celebrations of independence day having given way to political and economic turmoil one thing has become especially clear about the former London mayor Boris Johnson and other leaders of the successful campaign to vote Britain out of the European Union They had no plan for what comes next In the days since Britain voted to leave the bloc the movements leaders have often appeared as if they had not expected to win and were not prepared to cope with the consequences Faced with the scope of the decision they have been busy walking back promises they made during the campaign and scaling back expectations They have failed to show a united front or to answer basic questions Their faltering performance has added to the sense of political chaos in Britain and arguably to the turmoil in the financial markets And it has undercut their credibility and authority as Mr Johnson prepares his bid to become prime minister and lead Britain into a new relationship with the Continent The stakes are high for Mr Johnson in particular as he tries to build an impression as a capable leader amid the chaos that followed the vote in favor of a British exit or Brexit  But the mixed signals coming from him and other proponents of leaving the European Union have left their intentions unclear on such basic issues as when and how they will seek to negotiate a withdrawal and what kind of new arrangement they want To the degree that they have signaled a direction it has often been substantially different from what they promised during the campaign On issues from immigration to spending on the National Health Service the Leave coalition has retreated from its more populist and apparently exaggerated claims Many of those assertions had been promoted by the   U K Independence Party or UKIP led by Nigel Farage and benefited the broader Leave campaign whose most prominent figures included two senior Conservatives Mr Johnson and Michael Gove the justice minister In changing their tune the leaders of the   Union campaign risk undermining whatever trust they had earned from the millions who voted to leave the bloc in the expectation that immigration would be cut sharply and that money now going to the European Union     which the Leave campaign said was 350 million pounds or 465 million a week     would be available to help finance the National Health Service For example one Leave advocate Iain Duncan Smith a former Conservative Party leader and cabinet secretary walked away from the campaign pledge to reallocate the 350 million a week to the health service Instead he said the lions share of anything left from that amount after replacing subsidies from the bloc to British farmers could be available for health services On immigration too there was immediate backtracking from Mr Johnson and Daniel Hannan a member of the European Parliament from the Conservative Party who told the BBC Frankly if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the E U they are going to be disappointed  Analysts say the change in tone may be necessary to begin reeling in unrealistic expectations about the changes the referendum could produce but it also holds considerable political peril for Mr Johnson and other Conservative Party leaders of the Leave campaign especially with populist sentiment spreading and   groups like the U K Independence Party eager to build support There is a clear tension between what the voter wanted and what senior euroskeptic leaders want to produce said Matthew Goodwin a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Kent If they dont deliver radical reforms on immigration it would be the equivalent of pouring gasoline on the populist UKIP fire that has been burning since 2010  In his regular column in The Daily Telegraph on Monday Mr Johnson tried to strike a prime ministerial tone of unity in the wake of the divisive referendum but he emphasized continuity over change and tried to argue that immigration clearly the primary motivation for many voters in taking a position against Europe was somehow not a major issue It is said that those who voted Leave were mainly driven by anxieties about immigration Mr Johnson wrote I do not believe that is so  Suggesting that he wants to keep some kind of open flow of people across the border with Europe Mr Johnson wrote British people will still be able to go and work in the E U to live to travel to study to buy homes and to settle down  Not only that he asserted There will continue to be free trade and access to the single market  What he described was a relationship with the European Union like that of Norway which would allow freedom of movement and labor and would pay money to Brussels in return for access to the single market but without having a voice in   But Mr Johnson rejected the Norway model during the campaign and even if negotiations proved to lead to a slightly enhanced Norway with some symbolic measures to restrict immigration of European Union citizens to Britain the result would be a betrayal of those who voted Leave And right now Norway pays Brussels roughly per capita what Britain currently does as a full member The difficulty for Boris and Gove is that Brexit feels like a column gone wrong an academic exercise suddenly turned into reality Paul Waugh wrote in his blog for The Huffington Post alluding to the shared backgrounds in journalism of Mr Johnson and Mr Gove And reality particularly where the E U is concerned is a messy complex thing  Mr Johnson is clearly looking to unite the divided Conservative Party behind his own flamboyant self and to burnish his   economic credentials But playing down immigration Mr Goodwin said could create more political trouble I worry for senior euroskeptic leaders because there is a misunderstanding of the vote and that will feed voter dissatisfaction he said driving many of the voters who chose a British exit to turn away from both mainstream parties and move to the populist right The referendum was unusual because it pitted a government on one side Remain against a loose coalition on the other made up of Conservatives some Labour legislators and U K Independence Party supporters The Leave side never had to hammer out an agreement on how to proceed if it won said Tony Travers a professor of government at the London School of Economics There was no coherence because it wasnt a political party fighting for government but an odd coalition fighting against something but with no consistent view of what it was fighting for he said Even on the economy the Leave side was made of   economists who believe in no tariffs at all those who believe in trade deals and protectionists who want to shield the declining working class against globalization Professor Travers said And now the government will have to be reformed as if it were representing the Leave side and yet represent both a   government that must reflect the schism in itself he said In the aftermath of the Leave campaigns victory the political editor for Sky News Faisal Islam asked a Conservative member of Parliament who supported leaving the bloc to see his camps plan The legislator replied according to Mr Islam There is no plan The Leave campaign dont have a   plan  Then the legislator added Number 10 should have had a plan referring to the prime ministers office,0,london with their giddy celebrations

33,33,Texas Oil Fields Rebound From Price Lull but Jobs Are Left Behind  The New York Times,Clifford Krauss,MIDLAND Tex     In the land where oil jobs were once a guaranteed road to security for   workers Eustasio Velazquezs career has been upended by technology For 10 years he laid cables for service companies doing seismic testing in the search for the next big gusher Then powerful computer hardware and software replaced cables with wireless data collection and he lost his job He found new work connecting pipes on rigs but lost that job too when plunging oil prices in 2015 forced the driller he worked for to replace rig hands with cheaper more reliable automated tools I dont see a future Mr Velazquez 44 said on a recent afternoon as he stooped over his shopping cart at a local grocery store Pretty soon every rig will have one worker and a robot  Oil and gas workers have traditionally had some of the     jobs     just the type that President Trump has vowed to preserve and bring back But the West Texas oil fields where activity is gearing back up as prices rebound illustrate how difficult it will be to meet that goal As in other industries automation is creating a new demand for   workers     sometimes hundreds of miles away in a control center     but their numbers dont offset the ranks of field hands no longer required to sling chains and lift iron So while there is a general sense of relief in the oil patch that a recovery is gaining momentum discussions at company meetings and family kitchen tables are rife with aching worries especially among those who are   with no more than a high school education Roughly 163 000 oil jobs were lost nationally from the 2014 peak or about 30 percent of the total while oil prices plummeted at one point by as much as 70 percent The job losses just in Texas the most productive   state totaled 98 000 Several thousand workers have come back to work in recent months as the price of oil has begun to rise again but energy experts say that between a third and a half of the workers who lost their jobs are not returning Many have migrated to construction or even jobs in renewable energy like wind power People have left the industry and they are not coming back said Michael Dynan vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm a Pennsylvania manufacturer of drilling rigs If its a repetitive task it can be automated and I dont need someone to do that I can get a computer to do that  Indeed computers now direct drill bits that were once directed manually The wireless technology taking hold across the oil patch allows a handful of geoscientists and engineers to monitor the drilling and completion of multiple wells at a time     onshore or miles out to sea     and supervise immediate fixes when something goes wrong all without leaving their desks It is a world where rigs walk on their own legs and sensors on wells alert headquarters to a leak or loss of pressure reducing the need for a technician to check And despite all the lost workers United States oil production is galloping upward to nine million barrels a day from 8 6 million in September Nationwide with a bit more than   as many rigs operating as in 2014 production is not even down 10 percent from record levels Some of the best wells here in the Permian Basin that three years ago required an oil price of over 60 a barrel for an operator to break even now need about 35 well below the current price of about 53 Much of the technology has been developed by the aviation and automotive industries along with deepwater oil exploration over more than a decade But companies drilling on land were slow to adapt until oil prices crashed and companies needed to get efficient quickly or go out of business All the big companies and many smaller ones have organized teams of technicians that collect well and tank data to develop complex algorithms enabling them to duplicate the design for the most productive wells over and over and to repair valves and other parts before they break down The result is improved production and safety but also a far smaller work force and one that is increasingly morphing from muscle to brain power Pioneer Natural Resources one of the most productive West Texas producers has slashed the number of days to drill and complete wells so drastically that it has been able to cut costs by 25 percent in wells completed since early 2015 The typical rig that drilled eight to 12 wells a year just a few years ago now drills up to 16 Last year the company added nearly 240 wells to its Permian Basin inventory without adding new employees The faster operations Pioneer executives say are due in large part to more effective well planning and drill steering Both have been made possible by the   computer connections between the rig and top geoscientists back at corporate headquarters and intense analysis of the data gathered at every well The laborious task of checking tank levels by climbing a flight of steps and popping open a series of latches for instance has been replaced by pressing a few icons on a computer touch screen A fully automated water pump station installed last summer is intended to save hundreds of truck trips every day hauling water for hydraulically fracturing wells yielding diesel and labor cost savings We want to transform our work force to the point where we need to hire fewer people said Joey Hall Pioneers executive vice president for Permian operations Improved computing streamlines operations he noted and lets technicians optimally space their wells and more accurately perforate the sweet spots of shale veins to squeeze every drop of oil out of the ground Were heading toward artificial intelligence and machine learning analyzing thousands of algorithms Mr Hall added sounding more like a Silicon Valley futurologist than a wildcatter Through repetitive operations you learn the patterns and through patterns you learn to make automated decisions  With the loss of manual jobs has come a transformation in the job force with demand growing for more data analysts math scientists communications specialists and robotic design engineers In the last two years ABB the Swiss technology company has opened two plants in Houston for assembling and packaging robotics and integrating advanced instrumentation into oil field operations GE Oil and Gas opened a technology center in Oklahoma City in October to place scientists closer to the oil fields to research and apply new digital industrial technologies for exploration and production Among its many projects is an experiment to use drones to inspect equipment and identify methane leaks on oil sites Nabors the oil services giant has 100 employees developing software 10 times the number it had only a few years ago With the adoption of all this   software and stuff weve had to bring in a lot of new technicians said Dennis A Smith a Nabors vice president A typical new oil company employee is Andre Nel a    mechanical engineer who is a rising star at Pioneer Natural Resources In less than two years he has helped rewrite computer software to instruct workers on the best designs for hydraulic fracturing optimizing the amounts of fluids sand and chemicals pumped into the wells Now connected by computers to technicians in the field he is monitoring the production of 950 wells instantly checking the maintenance history and production trends of every well with the click of a mouse Im lucky and happy that the tech revolution in the oil field has created the need for engineers like me with backgrounds in computer science he said But smaller companies and their workers are struggling to keep up S O C Industries a small local pump truck operator and chemical services provider is forced to invest 100 000 a year to keep up with the computer programs and monitoring equipment its clients request The added expenses are one reason the company has let go 15 of the 60 field workers employed three years ago Another is that well operators that once hired five or six people on a drill site to mix chemicals and drilling fluids as well as clean up spills are now hiring only three as mechanization has sliced their drilling time in half Some of the remaining S O C employees are straining to keep up with new computerized pump truck monitors and GPS systems Its a struggle said Rodrigo Urias 59 an S O C truck driver who for many years only had to look at a needle on a gauge to monitor flow pressures Now he needs to reset computer screens take work orders on a computer tablet and sometimes do algebraic calculations A lot of the guys cant operate these new technologies tablets and instruments and they keep whining he added They want to know why we cant do things like we used to  Manufacturing executives say they are trying to minimize the complexity for field workers and sometimes design their equipment with the advice of video game makers Thats a good thing for Michael Manga 34 an employee of Latshaw Drilling an Oklahoma company active here A college dropout he knocked around from job to job before finding his way to the oil patch Now playing video games like Call of Duty and Mario Kart with his friends over the years has paid off giving him the   coordination to monitor and operate the control panels and joy sticks that control the drilling rig We do

34,34,Bayer Deal for Monsanto Follows Agribusiness Trend Raising Worries for Farmers  The New York Times,Leslie Picker Danny Hakim and Michael J de la Merced,Don Halcomb a    farmer in Adairville Ky is expecting his profit to vanish this year largely because of the confluence of falling crop prices and rising costs for seeds and other materials The price of an   bag of seed corn rose to 300 from 80 in the last decade as the companies that produced them consolidated he said And with the recent decline in commodity prices Mr Halcomb said he expects to lose 100 an acre this year Were producing our crops at a loss now just like the oil guys are pumping oil at a loss Mr Halcomb who grows corn soybeans wheat and barley on his   family farm said by telephone on Wednesday You cant cut your costs fast enough  It is a common plight of farmers across the United States with the global agriculture industry in a wrenching downturn Because farmers have produced too much corn wheat and soybeans they have been forced to slash prices to sell their crops They have also reduced spending on seeds pesticides and fertilizer which has eaten into sales at agribusiness giants including Monsanto and DuPont In response these companies have sought   deals to cut costs and weather the industrys storm Four major agribusiness mergers have been announced in the last year The latest is Bayer AGs 56 billion takeover of Monsanto     the largest acquisition of 2016     announced on Wednesday Every merger creates the possibility of higher costs for farmers Mr Halcomb buys seeds with traits licensed to Monsanto of St Louis and seeds from DuPont which has a deal pending to merge with Dow Chemical His fertilizers are made of potassium compounds and phosphate produced by Agrium of Calgary Alberta which on Monday agreed to combine with the fertilizer producer Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan He uses pesticides made by Syngenta of Switzerland which agreed in February to a takeover by the China National Chemical Corporation Its just like any other industry that consolidates Mr Halcomb said They tell the regulators theyre   and then they tell their customers they have to increase pricing after the deals done  The companies say they are merging to diversify and increase growth and research capabilities but these deals given their size and scope have already caught the attention of lawmakers and regulators in Washington There is no guarantee that they will all receive regulatory approval and some companies may have to sell assets to allay antitrust concerns Dows merger with DuPont is under Justice Department review The market seemed to anticipate hurdles for the Monsanto deal on Wednesday Shares of the company closed about 20 percent lower than the 128 per share cash offer from Bayer which is based in Leverkusen Germany Shares of each company gained less than 1 percent after the deal was announced Adding the assumption of about 10 billion of Monsanto debt Bayers total 66 billion pact is the largest   deal according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters ahead of InBevs 60 4 billion offer for another St   company   in June 2008 Senator Charles E Grassley Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee scheduled a hearing next week to discuss the possible effect of these   mergers on farming Iowa produced more corn last year than any other state according to the National Corn Growers Association It seems to be catching fire and happening so fast with so many Senator Grassley said in a phone interview When you have less competition prices go up  European competition regulators also said publicly before a   deal was even signed that they would look at how it could affect prices and the availability of seed products as well as research Liam Condon who leads Bayers   division said in an interview that the company did an extensive analysis with regard to antitrust before approaching Monsanto in May Mr Condon said that he does not believe there is much overlap between their portfolios because Bayers focus is largely on crop protection while Monsantos is on seeds and traits He said the companies assume they may need to sell off some assets to appease regulators Monsanto which is famous for its production of genetically modified seeds rejected several offers from Bayer as too low Wednesdays deal represented a 44 percent premium to Monsantos stock price on May 9 the day before Bayers interest in a deal surfaced To assuage Monsantos concerns Bayer threw in a 2 billion breakup fee if the deal fell apart on antitrust grounds The strategic goal of the deal according to Bill Selesky an analyst at Argus Research is to create a    experience for farmers making Bayer the worlds largest supplier of seeds and farm chemicals By improving the product for farmers the combined company could ultimately raise prices Mr Selesky said in an interview Senator Grassley said that he had spoken with a few farmers who believed the deals were necessary so large agribusinesses could continue to absorb the costs of researching and developing products and getting government approval for them Bayer and Monsanto said they planned to cut about 1 2 billion worth of costs as part of the deal helping to improve efficiency But Jim Benham of Versailles Ind the president of the Indiana Farmers Union was not so optimistic He blamed the rising costs of inputs     seeds fertilizer and the like     for eating away at farmers profit margins and warned that consolidation will make it worse Costs have already risen by double digits over the last four to five years and the proposed   merger could accelerate that The merger is going to hurt the farmer said Mr Benham who grows corn soybeans and sometimes wheat on his   farm The more consolidation we have on our inputs the worse it gets  Mr Condon of Bayer said that the company would not raise prices without providing more value to farmers This is a highly competitive industry and just increasing prices without having any additional advantage or benefit for growers wont go anywhere he said Its up to us to show what were offering will help farmers improve their return on investment  Some farmers said the consolidation could even enable prices to fall Christine Hamilton manages a farm of more than 12 000 acres in Kimball S D growing crops like corn and operating a ranch She said that if the deal can pass the antitrust screening then maybe it could actually help farmers I understand how companies need to get bigger in order to be competitive she said

35,35,Russia Moves to Ban Jehovahs Witnesses as Extremist  The New York Times,Andrew Higgins,VOROKHOBINO Russia     A dedicated pacifist who has never even held a gun Andrei Sivak discovered that his government considered him a dangerous extremist when he tried to change some money and the teller suddenly looked up at me with a face full of fear  His name had popped up on the exchange bureaus computer system along with those of members of Al Qaeda the Islamic State and other militant groups responsible for shocking acts of violence The only group the    father of three has ever belonged to however is Jehovahs Witnesses a Christian denomination committed to the belief that the Bible must be taken literally particularly its injunction Thou shalt not kill  Yet in a throwback to the days of the Soviet Union when Jehovahs Witnesses were hounded as spies and malcontents by the K G B the denomination is at the center of an escalating campaign by the authorities to curtail religious groups that compete with the Russian Orthodox Church and that challenge President Vladimir V Putins efforts to rally the country behind traditional and often militaristic patriotic values The Justice Ministry in a preliminary adminstrative strike last month put the headquarters of Jehovahs Witnesses in Russia an office complex near St Petersburg on a list of the bodies banned in connection with the carrying out of extremist activities  Whether it stays there will depend on Russias Supreme Court which is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to hear a request from the Justice Ministry to outlaw the religious organization and stop its more than 170 000 Russian members from spreading extremist texts Extremism as defined by a law passed in 2002 but amended and expanded several times since has become a catchall charge that can be deployed against just about anybody as it has been against some of those involved in recent   protests in Moscow and scores of other cities Several students who took part in demonstrations in the Siberian city of Tomsk are now being investigated by a special   unit while Leonid Volkov the senior aide to the jailed protest leader Aleksei A Navalny said he himself was detained last week under the extremism law In the case of Jehovahs Witnesses the putative extremism seems to derive mostly from the groups absolute opposition to violence a stand that infuriated Soviet and now Russian authorities whose legitimacy rests in large part on the celebration of martial triumphs most notably over Nazi Germany in World War II but also over rebels in Syria Jehovahs Witnesses members of a denomination founded in the United States in the 19th century and active in Russia for more than 100 years refuse military service do not vote and view God as the only true leader They shun the patriotic festivals promoted with gusto by the Kremlin like the annual celebration of victory in 1945 and recent events to celebrate the annexation of Crimea in March 2014 Mr Sivak who says he lost his job as a physical education teacher because of his role as a Jehovahs Witnesses elder said he voted for Mr Putin in 2000 three years before joining the denomination He added that while he had not voted since nor had he supported   activities of the sort that usually attract the attention of Russias   version of the K G B the Federal Security Service or F S B I have absolutely no interest in politics he said during a recent Jehovahs Witnesses Friday service in a wooden country house in Vorokhobino a   village north of Moscow Around 100 worshipers crammed into a long chilly room under fluorescent lights to listen to readings from the Bible sing and watch a video advising them to dress for worship as they would for a meeting with the president From the Russian states perspective Jehovahs Witnesses are completely separate said Geraldine Fagan the author of Believing in Russia     Religious Policy After Communism  She added They dont get involved in politics but this is itself seen as a suspicious political deviation  The idea of independent and public religious activity that is completely outside the control of     and also indifferent to     the state sets all sorts of alarm bells ringing in the Orthodox Church and the security services she said That the worldwide headquarters of Jehovahs Witnesses is in the United States and that its publications are mostly prepared there Ms Fagan added all adds up to a big conspiracy theory for the increasingly assertive F S B For Mr Sivak it has added up to a long legal nightmare His troubles began he said when undercover security officers posed as worshipers and secretly filmed a service where he was helping to officiate in 2010 Accused of inciting hatred and disparaging the human dignity of citizens he was put on trial for extremism along with a second elder Vyacheslav Stepanov 40 The prosecutors case heard by a municipal court in Sergiyev Posad a center of the Russian Orthodox Church produced no evidence of extremism and focused instead on the insufficient patriotism of Jehovahs Witnesses Their disregard for the state a report prepared for the prosecution said erodes any sense of civic affiliation and promotes the destruction of national and state security  In a ruling last year the court found the two men not guilty and their ordeal seemed over     until Mr Sivak tried to change money and was told that he had been placed on a list of terrorists and extremists  He and Mr Stepanov now face new charges of extremism and are to appear before a regional court this month There is a big wave of repression breaking Mr Stepanov said In response to written questions the Justice Ministry in Moscow said a yearlong review of documents at the Jehovahs Witnesses administrative center near St Petersburg had uncovered violations of a Russian law banning extremism As a result it added the center should be liquidated along with nearly 400 locally registered branches of the group and other structures For the denominations leaders in Russia the sharp escalation in a long campaign of harassment previously driven mostly by local officials drew horrifying flashbacks to the Soviet era Vasily Kalin the chairman of Jehovahs Witnesses Russian arm recalled that his whole family had been deported to Siberia when he was a child It is sad and reprehensible that my children and grandchildren should be facing a similar fate he said Never did I expect that we would again face the threat of religious persecution in modern Russia  In Russia as in many countries the    proselytizing of Jehovahs Witnesses often causes irritation and their theological idiosyncrasies disturb many mainstream Christians The group has also been widely criticized for saying that the Bible prohibits blood transfusions But it has never promoted violent or even peaceful political resistance I cannot imagine that anyone really thinks they are a threat said Alexander Verkhovsky director of the SOVA Center for Information and Analysis which monitors extremism in Russia But they are seen as a good target They are pacifists so they cannot be radicalized no matter what you do to them They can be used to send a message  That message it would seem is that everyone needs to get with the Putin program     or risk being branded as an extremist for displaying indifference never mind hostility to the Kremlins drive to make Russia a great power again A big reason they are being targeted is simply that they are an easy target Ms Fagan said They dont vote so nobody is going to lose votes by attacking them  Attacking Jehovahs Witnesses also sends a signal that even the mildest deviation from the norm if proclaimed publicly and insistently can be punished under the   law which was passed after Russias second war in Chechnya and the Sept 11 attacks in the United States Billed as a move by Russia to join a worldwide struggle against terrorism the law prohibited incitement of racial national or religious strife and social hatred associated with violence or calls for violence  But the reference to violence was later deleted opening the way for the authorities to classify as extremist any group claiming to offer a unique true path to religious or political salvation Even the Russian Orthodox Church has sometimes fallen afoul of the law The slogan Orthodoxy or Death     a rallying cry embraced by some   believers     has been banned as an illegal extremist text To help protect the Orthodox Church and other established religions Parliament passed a law in 2015 to exempt the Bible and the Quran as well as Jewish and Buddhist scripture from charges of extremism based on their claims to offer the only true faith The main impetus for the current crackdown however appears to come from the security services not the Orthodox Church Roman Lunkin director of the Institute of Religion and Law a Moscow research group described it as part of a broad policy of suppressing all nongovernmental organizations that has gained particular force because of the highly centralized structure of Jehovahs Witnesses under a worldwide leadership based in the United States They are controlled from outside Russia and this is very suspicious for our secret services he said They dont like having an organization that they do not and cannot control  Artyom Grigoryan a former Jehovahs Witness who used to work at the groups Russian headquarters but who now follows the Orthodox Church said the organization had many positive elements like its ban on excessive drinking smoking and other unhealthy habits All the same he said it deserved to be treated with suspicion Look at it from the view of the state he said Here is an organization that is run from America that gets financing from abroad and whose members dont serve in the army and dont vote  Estranged from his parents who are still members and view his departure as sinful he said Jehovahs Witnesses broke up families and in the logic of the state it presents a threat  He added I am not saying this is real or not but it needs to be checked by objective experts  Mr Sivak now preparing for yet another trial said that he

36,36,Re Why We Are Still In The Danger Zone Until January 20th 2017,greanfinisher ,"Why We Are Still In The Danger Zone Until January 20th 2017   17th 2016 
Donald Trump is not the president yet and Barack Obama could still do an extraordinary amount of damage during his last two months in the White House Prior to the election I described the period of time ending on January 20th as the danger zone and my outlook has not changed just because Donald Trump was victorious on election night As you will see the next two months are an absolutely critical time and if we can get through January 20th without something major happening perhaps we can breathe a little bit easier at least for a while On the other hand the events of the next two months could easily plunge this country into a period of unprecedented chaos A lot of people are feeling really good about things right now because of Trumps victory but now is definitely not a time to relax and let down our guard 
And the truth is that Donald Trump has not even won the presidency yet As I detailed shortly before election night  the next president will not be determined until December 19th when the Electoral College meets 
On Monday December 19th the members of the Electoral College will gather in all 50 state capitals to cast their votes for president It is then and only then that the next president of the United States will be elected 
Throughout our history electors have followed the will of the people more than 99 perfect of the time but there have been faithless electors before and if Democrats can get enough of them to switch sides in December it is still possible though not probable that Hillary Clinton could win the election 
One petition that is asking electors to switch their votes has already been signed by more than 4 million people The petition claims that Donald Trump is unfit to serve as president and that since Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a wide margin she should be elected president instead The following comes from a USA Today article entitled  Could the Electoral College elect Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump  
A Changeorg petition now signed by more than 43 million people encourages members of the Electoral College to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton when the college meets on Dec 19 The petition argues that Donald Trump is unfit to serve and that Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President 
If they all vote the way their states voted Donald Trump will win the petition states However they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose Even in states where that is not allowed their vote would still be counted they would simply pay a small fine  which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton 
Personally I dont believe that this is going to happen They may be able to flip a few electors but the gap in electoral votes is almost certainly too wide for the Democrats to overcome 
However that is not the only concern we are facing Ever since his victory on November 8th there have been a multitude of violent threats against Donald Trump and his family And without a doubt there are a lot of very powerful people that would be very interested in finding a way to keep Donald Trump from getting to Inauguration Day So let us pray for his safety and for the safety of his family 
If Donald Trump were to be incapacitated after he wins the Electoral College vote on December 19th Mike Pence would take his place 
But if something were to happen to him before December 19th his electors would be free to vote for another candidate  including Hillary Clinton 
If everything goes smoothly and Donald Trump successfully makes it to Inauguration Day he could be facing one of the biggest political protests in United States history 
In an article for The Most Important News  I showed that the far left is calling for thousands upon thousands of protesters to descend upon Washington DC on January 20th in order to disrupt the Inauguration festivities as much as possible 
This giant protest is being organized by the usual suspects and they have already put up Facebook pages  websites  and the hashtag DisruptJ20 is being widely used all over social media 
Traditionally Inauguration Day is a day of joy and celebration but the far left seems intent on transforming it into a massive riot 
Let us hope that they are not successful 
Another reason why we will be in the danger zone over the next two months is because of what Barack Obama may choose to do at the United Nations 
Now that it looks like Donald Trump is going to be our next president the international pressure on Barack Obama to do something at the United Nations regarding the IsraeliPalestinian conflict before the end of his term has become even more intense 
And this is something that Trump and his advisers are actively concerned about In fact I came across an article earlier today that discussed the fact that the Trump team is warning Obama against making moves on the IsraeliPalestinian conflict in his last months in office  
Saying that pushing agendas contrary to the presidentelects position would not be in the spirit of the transition Trump national security advisor for Donald Trump last week warned the Obama administration against making moves on the IsraeliPalestinian conflict in his last months in office 
On big transformative issues where President Obama and Presidentelect Trump are not in alignment I dont think its in keeping with the spirit of the transitionto try to push through agenda items that are contrary to the presidentelects positions the advisor told Politico  
Specifically the concern is that Obama may decide to support a UN Security Council resolution that would officially recognize a Palestinian state set the parameters for a two state solution and establish East Jerusalem as the capital for the new Palestinian state 
Just a few weeks ago an article in the Wall Street Journal entitled  Obamas Israel Surprise  reported that this is one of the options that the Obama administration is strongly considering right now A UN Security Council resolution would be legally binding on both Israel and the Palestinians and it would be something that President Trump would not be able to undo 
The rest of the UN Security Council is eager to support such a resolution and so the decision about whether this resolution is going to happen or not sits in the hands of Barack Obama and at this moment we do not know what he is going to do The following comes from an article by Leo Hohmann  
The Wall Street Journal reported one week before Tuesdays election that Obama had requested his aides provide him with a list of options to deal with the decadesold IsraeliPalestinian conflict 
Israeli diplomats according to the WSJ story are preparing for the possibility that a lameduck President Obama may try to force a diplomatic resolution for Israel and the Palestinians at the United Nations 
The president is presumably now reviewing those options which number about half a dozen 
He may be preparing to recognize a Palestinian state at the UN before he leaves office  WSJ reported 
If Barack Obama decides to divide the land of Israel at the United Nations it will be the worst decision of his entire presidency I have warned repeatedly that all hell will break loose in America if it happens and it will also mean that many of the events that I warn about in my latest book are much closer than many had been anticipating 
But if we can get to January 20th and the land of Israel has not been divided yet we may be able to rest easy for at least a little while because Trump has already said that he would not support a UN Security Council resolution that forces a solution on the Israelis and Palestinians 
When politicians are going to do something that they know people wont like they tend to try to sneak it through around the holidays when a lot of people arent paying attention For example yesterday I discussed how the legislation that created the Federal Reserve was rushed through Congress right before Christmas in 1913  
So keep an eye on the period around Thanksgiving and the period around Christmas If Barack Obama is going to stab Israel in the back it may happen during one of those times 
My hope is that we can get through January 20th without anything going seriously wrong If that happens I know that I will be very thankful 
And as I detailed in a previous article  Donald Trump will be 70 years 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day in office on January 21st and that will happen in year 5777 on the Hebrew calendar 
Could that be a sign of better things ahead as many believe 
Or will the next two months set off a chain of events that will be absolutely disastrous for this nation 
I believe that this is an absolutely critical moment in our history and let us hope that our leaders make the right decisions 
Danger Zone Brings back memories of Kenny Loggins and Top Gun anonymous 
Listen to her howlin roar Metal under tension Beggin you to touch and go Highway to the Danger Zone Ride into the Danger Zone Headin into twilight Spreadin out her wings tonight She got you jumpin off the deck And shovin into overdrive Highway to the Danger Zone Ill take you Right into the Danger Zone William Lutz 
I will not celebrate the holidays this year Screw Christmas and New Years already anonymous 
Good on you Why support corporate mandated holidays anyway Thanksgiving should be the most important celebration We should also celebrate the day of the dead A solemn reminder of what the future holds for us all Besides their parties are awesome Ricardo 
We should also celebrate the day of the dead  that is spiritism 
King Saul tried to bring up the dead Samuel via the witch of Endor dont mess with spiritism 
Let the dead bury the dead Matthew 822  meaning if you have no spiritual life you are dead so let the dead bury the dead 
Halloween October 31st What date did Martin Luther nail the 95 thesis to the church catholic door   October 31st Halloween is the catholic church playing with spiritism and fostering it on the world via the disguise of its just harmless fun dont mess with spiritism anonymous

Wrong again df NJ Dumb Friend from New Jersey God has gone to great extremes to make himself knowable When Jesus died on the Cross the veil of the Temple was torn by god from top to bottom as a sign the way into his presence had been given Put your faith in Jesus follow his teaching and that path will lead you to the Father and eternal life YOU CAN KNOW GOD Mondobeyondo 
Merry Hallothanksmaskwanzaanewyear nick 
I am a political atheist just to set the record straight Although I visit this site fairly often it is showing signs of paranoia and provoking fear When George W as elected there were many protesters they were just hidden away in free speech zones Of course there are many unhappy people as there were in 2000 and every election Trumps votes were less than 19 of the 325 million people in the country Will Trump bring jobs No not unless they are govt employees or funded by taxes There is only one way jobs are created and that is when there is demand for products and services A lot of people with their low paying jobs can hardly afford the basic necessities let alone keep playing the consumerism game I cannot see Obama doing anything that requires legislation as he is lame duck status now Perhaps this site needs to focus on the swamp getting filled with more careerists especially lobbyists I have been an expat for over 6 years it is a lovely peaceful warm day here Think I will go for a bicycle ride then a dip in 86 degree seawater I do have faith that not much will change and the sun will continue to rise even when it is obscured by clouds Peace and Loveit is the only way df NJ 
Obamas big political move will be to appoint an ultra liberal judge to the bench during the recess I just cant imagine that he doesnt leave office without punishing the Republicans for not taking Garland And given all the threats to taking away all of Obamas legacy this is the only thing left he has to make his mark on history Rick 
I dont think he can do that with a phone and pen Sorry HeyAHuman 
Could you imagine the pandemonium that would ensue if the Electoral College were to vote Hillary in Then wed be in a REAL danger zone Mondobeyondo 
Yes it would be It would be like the Krakatoa volcano erupting again df NJ 
That is not going to happen because the electors hate Hillary as much as you do It would be like cutting off one of your own fingers with a kitchen knife I think we are okay anonymous 
It always amazes me that people will look for signs in anything Remember the world was going to end in the year 2000 Then again in 2012 with the end of the Mayan Calendar 
Uncertainty is the only certainty there is and knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security

Its 1118 and still no second coming of Jesus Every single person reading this and posting on this board is going to be long dead and gone before Jesus returns James Staten 
You just fulfilled prophecy and you dont even know it  Jerry C 
No longer need to look for signs as they are happening whether or not youre looking By the way 2000  2012 were LSM saying it was ending I guess for you the fact Trump will be 70 years 7 months 7 days old on his first full day of office is coincidence You see coincidence believers see signs ISA4110 
Liberals have long since gone beyond Activism and descended to mobs all acting like spoiled children stamping their feet and screaming I want it NOW Its the politics of juvenile delinquency 
To be a liberal means you must lie deceive deflect and as a last resort attack a conservative 
Liberalism is godlessness df NJ 
You only criticize and hate on other peoples character what you do not like about your own character 
Otherwise if you are able to meet people as being sacred then all you have remaining is unconditional love and acceptance of other peoples flaws 
Where does civility come from if not from having respect for opposing opinions ISA4110 
The election is OVER These demonstrations mean nothing These are bunch of winy liberals breaking laws Did Conservative do these childish things in 08 or 12

I wonder what Obamas Pardon List looks like JC Teecher 
Jesse james Jackson a pawn for the left is pushing hard to have hitlery pardoned for all her crimes before she is even charged As a crook himself he has received a free pass because of his so called religious connections Bull caca Occult religions maybe Mondobeyondo 
Yes there is still a possibility that Hillary Clinton could still get in the Oval Office But a Trump presidency is pretty much a done deal knock on wood The Secret Service had better guard him and his family VERY closely From what Ive seen and heard President Obama is trying to make Trumps transition to the presidency very peaceful and orderly even though they hate each other Lets hope that Trumps presidency will be a successful one and that it heals the many divisions and other issues that plague our country Back in 1985 I bought a brand new book called The Art of the Deal at my college bookstore It was written by some guy named Donald Trump Yes I actually did read it df NJ 
Not a chance Hillary is dead and gone Mondobeyondo 
Barack Obama is actually liberal enough to sign a resolution that would divide the land of Israel Donald Trump would have to be pressured by outside forces to make such a decision Would he do it Dont know Although from what Ive heard President Putin of Russia likes Trump a lot df NJ 
We dropped 23000 bombs on five predominately Muslim countries in 2015 Maybe its time to give the Yinon plan a rest and stop bombing ragheads for Israel 
America first We have way too many problems and debt in this country to continue our foreign policies of American adventurism Wheres Pat Buchanan when you need him I think its time we return to a more traditional conservative approach to foreign policy The long war does absolutely nothing to make me feel safer on the streets of Newark or Jersey City I say eff em America first TheLulzWarrior 
Who fing cares Israel is not an US state so far they would simply refuse to go along such a plan Paul Patriot 
Freedom loving Americans should know what needs to happen if hitlery is said to be el presidente on December 19th 
The left can whine shout protest and riotits time freedom loving Americans get the right mind set about standing up to tyrannyand apathy passivity fear and political correctness will prove ineffective 
The liberty tree is getting mighty thirstyjust saying df NJ 
There are many forms of freedom You criticize the left but you just dont understand it Heres how the left thinks 
An old English judge once said Necessitous men are not free men Liberty requires opportunity to make a living  a living decent according to the standard of the time a living which gives man not only enough to live by but something to live for 
For too many of us the political equality we once had won was meaningless in the face of economic inequality A small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other peoples property other peoples money other peoples labor  other peoples lives For too many of us life was no longer free liberty no longer real men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness 
Against economic tyranny such as this the American citizen could appeal only to the organized power of government  
You many not agree with this approach but ALL the evidence shows wealth inequality is at all time highs Most of you right wingers claim we have too much socialism and communism in this country The sad fact is we cannot be further way from communism and still have a currency with any shred of value 
But do not fear Every year the top 1 become richer and richer Every year the middle class is driven deeper and deeper into poverty wages Marx said laissez faire capitialism is always followed by communism because unfettered greed would result in a governments currency collapse Once the currency collapses people in bread lines will DEMAND more government not less 
See you in the breadlines comrades хорошего дня JC Teecher

mondobeyondo yes it would be it would be like the krakatoa volcano erupting again df nj that is not going to happen because the electors hate hillary as much as you do it would be like cutting off one of your own fingers with a kitchen knife i think we are okay anonymous it always amazes me that people will look for signs in anything remember the world was going to end in the year 2000 then again in 2012 with the end of the mayan calendar uncertainty is the only certainty there is and knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security john allen paulos df nj its 1118 and still no second coming of jesus every single person reading this and posting on this board is going to be long dead and gone before jesus returns james staten you just fulfilled prophecy and you dont even know it jerry c no longer need to look for signs as they are happening whether or not youre looking by the way 2000 2012 were lsm saying it was ending i guess for you the fact trump will be 70 years 7 months 7 days old on his first full day of office is coincidence you see coincidence believers see signs isa4110 liberals have long since gone beyond activism and descended to mobs all acting like spoiled children stamping their feet and screaming i want it now its the politics of juvenile delinquency to be a liberal means you must lie deceive deflect and as a last resort attack a conservative liberalism is godlessness df nj you only criticize and hate on other peoples character what you do not like about your own character otherwise if you are able to meet people as being sacred then all you have remaining is unconditional love and acceptance of other peoples flaws where does civility come from if not from having respect for opposing opinions isa4110 the election is over these demonstrations mean nothing these are bunch of winy liberals breaking laws did conservative do these childish things in 08 or 12 n i wonder what obamas pardon list looks like jc teecher jesse james jackson a pawn for the left is pushing hard to have hitlery pardoned for all her crimes before she is even charged as a crook himself he has received a free pass because of his so called religious connections bull caca occult religions maybe mondobeyondo yes there is still a possibility that hillary clinton could still get in the oval office but a trump presidency is pretty much a done deal knock on wood the secret service had better guard him and his family very closely from what ive seen and heard president obama is trying to make trumps transition to the presidency very peaceful and orderly even though they hate each other lets hope that trumps presidency will be a successful one and that it heals the many divisions and other issues that plague our country back in 1985 i bought a brand new book called the art of the deal at my college bookstore it was written by some guy named donald trump yes i actually did read it df nj not a chance hillary is dead and gone mondobeyondo barack obama is actually liberal enough to sign a resolution that would divide the land of israel donald trump would have to be pressured by outside forces to make such a decision would he do it dont know although from what ive heard president putin of russia likes trump a lot df nj we dropped 23000 bombs on five predominately muslim countries in 2015 maybe its time to give the yinon plan a rest and stop bombing ragheads for israel america first we have way too many problems and debt in this country to continue our foreign policies of american adventurism wheres pat buchanan when you need him i think its time we return to a more traditional conservative approach to foreign policy the long war does absolutely nothing to make me feel safer on the streets of newark or jersey city i say eff em america first thelulzwarrior who fing cares israel is not an us state so far they would simply refuse to go along such a plan paul patriot freedom loving americans should know what needs to happen if hitlery is said to be el presidente on december 19th the left can whine shout protest and riotits time freedom loving americans get the right mind set about standing up to tyrannyand apathy passivity fear and political correctness will prove ineffective the liberty tree is getting mighty thirstyjust saying df nj there are many forms of freedom you criticize the left but you just dont understand it heres how the left thinks an old english judge once said necessitous men are not free men liberty requires opportunity to make a living a living decent according to the standard of the time a living which gives man not only enough to live by but something to live for for too many of us the political equality we once had won was meaningless in the face of economic inequality a small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other peoples property other peoples money other peoples labor other peoples lives for too many of us life was no longer free liberty no longer real men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness against economic tyranny such as this the american citizen could appeal only to the organized power of government you many not agree with this approach but all the evidence shows wealth inequality is at all time highs most of you right wingers claim we have too much socialism and communism in this country the sad fact is we can not be further way from communism and still have a currency with any shred of value but do not fear every year the top 1 become richer and richer every year the middle class is driven deeper and deeper into poverty wages marx said laissez faire capitialism is always followed by communism because unfettered greed would result in a governments currency collapse once the currency collapses people in bread lines will demand more government not less see you in the breadlines comrades jc teecher it is fairly evident that b hussein odrama is spewing his nwo rhetoric and propaganda overseas as he attempts to assume the role of the worlds authoritarian he was handpicked by the biggest nazi since hitler behind the scenes as in ghw bush odrama was chosen by the underworld as a successor to ghwb and billery why to fulfill their occultic destiny of the beast system of gov religion education and economics the four hidden dynasties also viewed as dienasty if one is part of it anything is possible in the next two months and with the huge amounts of invested into continuing an evil empire the underworldshadow gov will use any and all means to make their plans come to fruition all we as christians can do is prepare for the worst and pray for the will of god to become manifest for his purpose pleasure and fulfillment of the end of days of this age the time of the fulfillment of a 100

The Podesta emails  After Hillary John Podesta had been seriously warned about the Syrian chaos Posted by nmb  Nov 18 2016 15959 PM  1 
Although it is hilarious to see the Hillary supporters throwing a massive tantrum about fake news it does make it clear just how powerful having direct access to information is in negating money mainstream media capture and control and government propaganda 
I dont know how much the new Trump presidency will change the US intelligence agency culture But one has to assume they are apoplectic over their failure in Syria Billions of dollars and years wasted all because people have direct access to information unfiltered out of Syria 
It should have a completely unremarkable US regime change operation 
 Send in the NGOs to agitate locals  Make promises of support for attacks on the government by the sole world superpower  Get selectively edited footage of your collaborators on the ground being attacked by the governmentafter they attacked the government  Pump out mass amounts of propaganda based off that footage Simple farmers rising up to overthrow a brutal regime  Wield the tremendous economic power of the US to ensure the vast majority of smaller countries are on board with military action sanctioned by the UN  Flood the country with arms for anyone no matter how crazy to attack the government  Fake chemical attacks US intelligence agency compromised UN reports and inspectors etc 
All of that derailed by nothing more than people having direct access to information uncensored out of Syria 
I think it is safe to assume the US intelligence agencies are actively working on ways to make it illegal or impossible for anyone to publish share or consume unauthorized information from countries that are targets of regime change 
The easiest way would be to designate any source of information not actively working with or approved by the US intelligence agencies will be increasingly labeled as terror propaganda and US social media and Internet providers will be required to censor or shutdown any such sources Posted by Stevens  Nov 18 2016 21640 PM  2 
Stevens  2 Great post thanks 
This regime change UA foreign policy has been implemented around the globe for many many years now all in the interests of big corporate profits and global hegemony The sad truth seems to be there are no signs its about to change Posted by ben  Nov 18 2016 23413 PM  3 
I was watching a travelogue program on PBS The trip was to Cuba The narrator traveled by train across the country A train line that was originally built in the 1870s by Spain to divide the country for defensive and control purposes The locomotives pulling the passenger cars were 1950s USA manufactured vintage and date to a time when our Federal Government had good economic relations with the Batista Regiem 
When I think of the cruel and unusual economic punishment dished out to Cuba by our Federal Government all I can see is a bunch of financially poor peasants who bear the brunt of US economic warfare Just as in the Middle East and now Europe economic sanction wars hurt the farmer the small business operator the basic family unit etc while rich people get richer Isnt it about time to back off on the economic war against Cuba and the rest of the Planet Our collective cruelty seems to know no bounds 
Just my opinion Posted by ALberto  Nov 18 2016 30002 PM  4 
Bernhard I should think most of us reading and commenting here have pretty much accepted the result of the US presidential elections and are glad that Killer Klintons ambitions have crashed and her future seems to be in a white house with steel bar columns and uniformed prison guards 
The focus is now on Presidentelect Donald Trumps likely cabinet appointments who are the most likely choices for critical positions like Defense Secretary and State Secretary what the process is and how that is being carried out or not carried out and what that says about Trumps leadership and decisionmaking style how he plans on being President and whether his choices are the right choices for his agenda if it is genuine of reforming the political culture on Capitol Hill or draining the swamp 
If indeed Trump is intent on bringing changes to Capitol Hill then theres a strong likelihood that the Sorosfunded Color Revolution rioting around the US East and West Coasts will come to Washington and well be seeing a reenactment of the Kiev Maidan events there Posted by Jen  Nov 18 2016 30127 PM  5 
Does the Constitution of the United States require the president to have a specific number of executive departments The answer is no George Washington only had four departments in his administration as first President of the United States 
Perhaps if Mr Trump cant find suitable candidates for his cabinet when he drains the swamp he could assume the role as interim department head until such time as qualified nonmilitarists emerge from the private sector to serve in his administration Posted by PokeTheTruth  Nov 18 2016 30434 PM  6 
2 stevensthanks for your comments lets hope open access to information continues the signs of this happening dont look great but they remain open still thankfully moa is one of many sites where sharing info is of great benefit and continues 
M K Bhadrakumars latest 
meanwhile obama merkel hollandaze and their italian counterpart have all agreed to continue for another year the sanctions on russia over ukraine the bozo head for nato jens stalenbread or however his name is spelled continues on with the disingenuous musings of an old king about to reenact a version of humpty dumpty 
meanwhile the witch hunt on acedemics or anyone associated with gulen continues in turkey erdogan was visiting pakistan the past few days and i happened to read this on the usa state dept daily transcript from yesterday in the form of a question 
Question Turkish President Erdogan is in Pakistan today and he publicly suggested to Pakistan that the West was behind ISIS in order to hurt Muslims quote It is certain that Western countries are standing by Daesh Now Iraq Pakistan Afghanistan and many others are suffering from terrorism and separatist terrorismWhats your comment on that Do you think its a reasonable statement 
MR KIRBY No I do not 
it is pretty funny how these daily press briefings highlight usa propaganda in such a distinct and colourful manner fortunately the odd journalist asks questions that lift the veil that is constantly being thrown out by these same masters of propaganda Posted by james  Nov 18 2016 33630 PM  7 
5 If indeed Trump is intent on bringing changes to Capitol Hill then theres a strong likelihood that the Sorosfunded Color Revolution rioting around the US East and West Coasts will come to Washington and well be seeing a reenactment of the Kiev Maidan events there 
No you will not be seeing Maidan Middle America white and not only working class men are extremely well armed and are really angry still So if this rioting will come to Washington who says that good ole Ford Truck can not run over mountain bike of Tesla Once the shooting starts hopefully not it will be a totally different game than Kiev Maidan There is also a trend call it a hunchmost of US combat veterans from US endless wars tend to lean towards people like Trump Posted by SmoothieX12  Nov 18 2016 34918 PM  8

The Right firmly believes in Onward Xtian Soldiers for the JudeoXtian Axis remember the 150000000000 that Obama Paid As Hostage to Iran was just a setup by the Right that was Irans sovereign national wealth held in overseas investments and illegally frozen by the Right as an act of war 
When Obama agreed to end those illegal sanctions and let Iran retrieve their investments which they may have done today if you look at the huge market selloff the Right again illegally crossed into Iran territory with their Navy patrol boats to create a false hostage narrative 
Those Navy boats know where they are by GPS withing 35 meters 10 feet and Iran didnt beat them or waterboard them like AbuGraib or Gitmo instead they traded them for their interest losses on their illegally frozen foreign investments 
With Huckabee as nee Ambassador to Israel and neocon Pompeo as named CIA Director and Jared Kushner getting top secret briefings to pass along to his Israeli blooddiamond partner Lev Leviev you can bet the Xtian Soldiers will be pouring our blood and our treasure onto the radioactive sands of the Middle East filling up the VA hospitals again for the JudeoXtian Axis of Greater Isreal

We have one month before the electoral college votes I suspect that this is the venue that the neolibcons will use to try to steal the election from Trump The demonstrators paid and organized by Soros et al help set the background and provide the rationale for the need to accept the will of the people 
If this should transpire then you will see civil unrest The red states will not go along with the theft of the election for Clinton Posted by Perimetr  Nov 18 2016 42835 PM  12

Soros paid for protesters is just more of bs fake news I have friends middle class professionals whove been participating in California and all they know about Soros is he made a ton of  on Brit Currency bets 2 decades ago 
The electors switch is not going to happen just more hysteria Posted by jdmckay  Nov 18 2016 44006 PM  13 If this should transpire then you will see civil unrest The red states will not go along with the theft of the election for Clinton 
Even the blue states have very large and populous red areasmostly beyond large urban centers which long ago became a cloaca of depravity My point is that this possible how probablethat is totally another discussion civil unrest once red states America gets involved seriously will not last too long for a number of purely tactical operational and logistical reasons This is if to discount the possibility of law enforcement actually enforcing the law and order which may under certain conditions turn very violent against those who will try to undermine constitutional process Blue states can not win for mostly cultural reasons since as I already stated Red states America is simply armed on several orders of magnitude better and is really angry It is also tougher Social and cultural composition of HRCs electorate speaks volumesit is in Steve Sailers words I think it was him a coalition of the fringes and not very capable to start with Posted by SmoothieX12  Nov 18 2016 44757 PM  14

WRT fake news and Soros paid rioters  Paul Horner  the 38yearold selfmade titan of a fake news empire on Facebook  is claiming responsibility for pushing Donald Trump to the White House and says he has no plans to stop publishing fake news 
In an interview with The Washington Post Horner attributed his success to Trumps particular base of supporters He is the man behind such viral headlines as The Amish in America Commit their Vote to Donald Trump and President Obama Signs Executive Order Banning the National Anthem at all Sporting Events Nationwide  neither of which were true 
My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time I think Trump is in the White House because of me His followers dont factcheck anything  theyll post everything believe anything His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid 3500 as fact Like I made that up I posted a fake ad on Craigslist he told The Washington Post Posted by jdmckay  Nov 18 2016 45236 PM  16 
The coming conflict is between globalism and nationalism The basic problem is numbers Rule by monopolistic global corporations at best supports 20 of the population in the short term It enriches the ruling elite and their servants and improvises everyone else In the long term climate change or a nuclear war brought on by the blind needs of greed will end the world as we know it Brexit and the Trump Presidency proved that globalism and democracy are incompatible For globalism to proceed in the middle term it will require a surveillance police state total propaganda reeducation camps and the shutdown of this bar Posted by VietnamVet  Nov 18 2016 45650 PM  17 
Who decides which news is fake Sounds like an easy way to limit freedom of speech and of the press 
Why cant people be allowed to decide for themselves which news is fake Posted by lysias  Nov 18 2016 45830 PM  18 
As a retired officer of the US Navy I would be very disappointed if a majority of the officer corps supported Hillary It would be very disappointing if they put their increased chances of promotion in new wars over the good of the country Disappointing but not exactly surprising Posted by lysias  Nov 18 2016 50117 PM  19 
I find it interesting that this open thread was not suppose to be about the US election but darn near all of the comments are to one degree or another Posted by psychohistorian  Nov 18 2016 51213 PM  20 
Its great that theres some dialog between Trump and Putin I think at least Western Syria will be cleansed of jihadis as a result 
But Trump might be a little more hard nosed in the future After the tensions are dialed down and having the score at basically Russia 1 US 0 hes not going to be so pliable He sure as fuck isnt going to throw Israel under a bus Hes not going to roll over on all American commitments in the region 
Trumps been getting a complete rundown on the big picture Its no secret that until recently he couldnt have found Damascus on a map Now he knows about the Shiite Crescent and how the arms can flow from Iran to Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon in volumes like never before and how upsetting that is for Israel 
Now theres action towards taking Raqqa by the Kurds and who knows who else The US and its posse will provide the air cover and logistics plus lots of special ops once it kicks in Im surprised the Kurds bit again after taking it up the arse from the US a couple of months ago Theyre not going all in right now as things are ongoing in Mosul and will be for a while But you dont hear Assad and the Russians squawking much about it Its like they both know that parts of Eastern Syria are byebye 
Trumps good will towards Russia certainly doesnt extend to Iran And no American will ever call Hezbollah anything bur a terrorist organization after the Marine barracks truck bombing in Beirut all those years ago If Putin and Trump are going to come to a general understanding in the ME theres going to have to be some give and take 
Putins done quite a turnaround in taking Russia from a pariah state a couple of years ago to the player on the world sage that it is now Its looking good for him to keep his man in power in Syria and to establish a permanent presence in the ME with Khmeimim and Tartus Once Trump is fully up to speed on the totality of American interests in the region he is bound by his office not to walk away from them There will have to be some serious dealmaking Posted by peter  Nov 18 2016 51647 PM  21 Putins done quite a turnaround in taking Russia from a pariah state a couple of years ago to the player on the world sage that it is now 
Your timeline is a bit off The coming of Putin was a direct result of NATOs 1999 aggression against Yugoslavia while War of 080808 was the start of Russias return into big league So it is not a couple of years Results of War of 080808 actually stunned DCs neocon interventionist cabal Posted by SmoothieX12  Nov 18 2016 52828 PM  22 Who decides which news is fake 
Buzzfeed did some analysis on Social media generated fake news during the election An awful lot of it was simply false You can look at some of those headlines and judge for yourself 
Ironically Paul Horner guy behind fake news empire I linked in prior post said He said he didnt do it for ideological reasons I hate Trump he told The Post I thought I was messing with the campaign maybe I wasnt messing them up as much as I wanted  but I never thought hed actually get elected 
Just happens 70  of fake news this election cycle according to Buzzfeed was antiClinton Posted by jdmckay  Nov 18 2016 54715 PM  23 
and how the arms can flow from Libya and ZioUkraine to ISIS in Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon in volumes like never before and how upsettingsic that is for Israel 
Yeah upsetting to the Israel Likud formerSoviet mafia which fully supports ISIS and maintains Hezbullah straw dog to keep UN forces out of Greater Israel and torpedo the TwoState Solution and the RightofReturn agreements which Netanyahu freely boasted he lied about supporting

I was referring to his exclusion after annexing Crimea The G8 turned into the G7 and he was shunned at the G20 It was decided by the US and its posse that world events would move along without any input from Russia That changed when he entered Syria Posted by peter  Nov 18 2016 64539 PM  25 
And on the climate change or not front there are these articles",1,open thread not us election 201639 news views not us election related 18 2016 at 0144 pm permalink comments the podesta emails after hillary john podesta had been seriously warned about the syrian chaos posted by nmb nov 18 2016 15959 pm 1 although it is hilarious to see the hillary supporters throwing a massive tantrum about fake news it does make it clear just how powerful having direct access to information is in negating money mainstream media capture and control and government propaganda i dont know how much the new trump presidency will change the us intelligence agency culture but one has to assume they are apoplectic over their failure in syria billions of dollars and years wasted all because people have direct access to information unfiltered out of syria it should have a completely unremarkable us regime change operation send in the ngos to agitate locals make promises of support for attacks on the government by the sole world superpower get selectively edited footage of your collaborators on the ground being attacked by the governmentafter they attacked the government pump out mass amounts of propaganda based off that footage simple farmers rising up to overthrow a brutal regime wield the tremendous economic power of the us to ensure the vast majority of smaller countries are on board with military action sanctioned by the un flood the country with arms for anyone no matter how crazy to attack the government fake chemical attacks us intelligence agency compromised un reports and inspectors etc all of that derailed by nothing more than people having direct access to information uncensored out of syria i think it is safe to assume the us intelligence agencies are actively working on ways to make it illegal or impossible for anyone to publish share or consume unauthorized information from countries that are targets of regime change the easiest way would be to designate any source of information not actively working with or approved by the us intelligence agencies will be increasingly labeled as terror propaganda and us social media and internet providers will be required to censor or shutdown any such sources posted by stevens nov 18 2016 21640 pm 2 stevens 2 great post thanks this regime change ua foreign policy has been implemented around the globe for many many years now all in the interests of big corporate profits and global hegemony the sad truth seems to be there are no signs its about to change posted by ben nov 18 2016 23413 pm 3 i was watching a travelogue program on pbs the trip was to cuba the narrator traveled by train across the country a train line that was originally built in the 1870s by spain to divide the country for defensive and control purposes the locomotives pulling the passenger cars were 1950s usa manufactured vintage and date to a time when our federal government had good economic relations with the batista regiem when i think of the cruel and unusual economic punishment dished out to cuba by our federal government all i can see is a bunch of financially poor peasants who bear the brunt of us economic warfare just as in the middle east and now europe economic sanction wars hurt the farmer the small business operator the basic family unit etc while rich people get richer isnt it about time to back off on the economic war against cuba and the rest of the planet our collective cruelty seems to know no bounds just my opinion posted by alberto nov 18 2016 30002 pm 4 bernhard i should think most of us reading and commenting here have pretty much accepted the result of the us presidential elections and are glad that killer klintons ambitions have crashed and her future seems to be in a white house with steel bar columns and uniformed prison guards the focus is now on presidentelect donald trumps likely cabinet appointments who are the most likely choices for critical positions like defense secretary and state secretary what the process is and how that is being carried out or not carried out and what that says about trumps leadership and decisionmaking style how he plans on being president and whether his choices are the right choices for his agenda if it is genuine of reforming the political culture on capitol hill or draining the swamp if indeed trump is intent on bringing changes to capitol hill then theres a strong likelihood that the sorosfunded color revolution rioting around the us east and west coasts will come to washington and well be seeing a reenactment of the kiev maidan events there posted by jen nov 18 2016 30127 pm 5 does the constitution of the united states require the president to have a specific number of executive departments the answer is no george washington only had four departments in his administration as first president of the united states perhaps if mr trump cant find suitable candidates for his cabinet when he drains the swamp he could assume the role as interim department head until such time as qualified nonmilitarists emerge from the private sector to serve in his administration posted by pokethetruth nov 18 2016 30434 pm 6 2 stevensthanks for your comments lets hope open access to information continues the signs of this happening dont look great but they remain open still thankfully moa is one of many sites where sharing info is of great benefit and continues m k bhadrakumars latest meanwhile obama merkel hollandaze and their italian counterpart have all agreed to continue for another year the sanctions on russia over ukraine the bozo head for nato jens stalenbread or however his name is spelled continues on with the disingenuous musings of an old king about to reenact a version of humpty dumpty meanwhile the witch hunt on acedemics or anyone associated with gulen continues in turkey erdogan was visiting pakistan the past few days and i happened to read this on the usa state dept daily transcript from yesterday in the form of a question question turkish president erdogan is in pakistan today and he publicly suggested to pakistan that the west was behind isis in order to hurt muslims quote it is certain that western countries are standing by daesh now iraq pakistan afghanistan and many others are suffering from terrorism and separatist terrorismwhats your comment on that do you think its a reasonable statement mr kirby no i do not it is pretty funny how these daily press briefings highlight usa propaganda in such a distinct and colourful manner fortunately the odd journalist asks questions that lift the veil that is constantly being thrown out by these same masters of propaganda posted by james nov 18 2016 33630 pm 7 5 if indeed trump is intent on bringing changes to capitol hill then theres a strong likelihood that the sorosfunded color revolution rioting around the us east and west coasts will come to washington and well be seeing a reenactment of the kiev maidan events there no you will not be seeing maidan middle america white and not only working class men are extremely well armed and are really angry still so if this rioting will come to washington who says that good ole ford truck can not run over mountain bike of tesla once the shooting starts hopefully not it will be a totally different game than kiev maidan there is also a trend call it a hunchmost of us combat veterans from us endless wars tend to lean towards people like trump posted by smoothiex12 nov 18 2016 34918 pm 8 2 the right firmly believes in onward xtian soldiers for the judeoxtian axis remember the 150000000000 that obama paid as hostage to iran was just a setup by the right that was irans sovereign national wealth held in overseas investments and illegally frozen by the right as an act of war when obama agreed to end those illegal sanctions and let iran retrieve their investments which they may have done today if you look at the huge market selloff the right again illegally crossed into iran territory with their navy patrol boats to create a false hostage narrative those navy boats know where they are by gps withing 35 meters 10 feet and iran didnt beat them or waterboard them like abugraib or gitmo instead they traded them for their interest losses on their illegally frozen foreign investments with huckabee as nee ambassador to israel and neocon pompeo as named cia director and jared kushner getting top secret briefings to pass along to his israeli blooddiamond partner lev leviev you can bet the xtian soldiers will be pouring our blood and our treasure onto the

the venue that the neolibcons will use to try to steal the election from trump the demonstrators paid and organized by soros et al help set the background and provide the rationale for the need to accept the will of the people if this should transpire then you will see civil unrest the red states will not go along with the theft of the election for clinton posted by perimetr nov 18 2016 42835 pm 12 12 soros paid for protesters is just more of bs fake news i have friends middle class professionals whove been participating in california and all they know about soros is he made a ton of on

states will not go along with the theft of the election for clinton even the blue states have very large and populous red areasmostly beyond large urban centers which long ago became a cloaca of depravity my point is that this possible how probablethat is totally another discussion civil unrest once red states america gets involved seriously will not last too long for a number of purely tactical operational and logistical reasons this is if to discount the possibility of law enforcement actually enforcing the law and order which may under certain conditions turn very violent against those who will try to undermine constitutional process blue states can not win for mostly cultural reasons since as i already stated red states america is simply armed on several orders of magnitude better and is really angry it is also tougher social and cultural composition of hrcs electorate speaks volumesit is in steve sailers words i think it was him a coalition of the fringes and not very capable to start with posted by smoothiex12 nov 18 2016 44757 pm 14 10 it would be interesting to see the breakdown of the military vote i dont hold my breath but againcall it a hunch i think that

38yearold selfmade titan of a fake news empire on facebook is claiming responsibility for pushing donald trump to the white house and says he has no plans to stop publishing fake news in an interview with the washington post horner attributed his success to trumps particular base of supporters he is the man behind such viral headlines as the amish in america commit their vote to donald trump and president obama signs executive order banning the national anthem at all sporting events nationwide neither of which were true my sites were picked up by trump supporters all the time i think trump is in the white house because of me his followers dont factcheck anything theyll post everything believe anything his campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid 3500 as fact like i made that up i posted a fake ad on craigslist he told the washington post posted by jdmckay nov 18 2016 45236 pm 16 the coming conflict is between globalism and nationalism the basic problem is numbers rule by monopolistic global corporations at best supports 20 of the population in the short term it enriches the ruling elite and their servants and improvises everyone else in the long term climate change or a nuclear war brought on by the blind needs of greed will end the world as we know it brexit and the trump presidency proved that globalism and democracy are incompatible for

at least western syria will be cleansed of jihadis as a result but trump might be a little more hard nosed in the future after the tensions are dialed down and having the score at basically russia 1 us 0 hes not going to be so pliable he sure as fuck isnt going to throw israel under a bus hes not going to roll over on all american commitments in the region trumps been getting a complete rundown on the big picture its no secret that until recently he couldnt have found damascus on a map now he knows about the shiite crescent and how the arms can flow from iran to syria to hezbollah in lebanon in volumes like never before and how upsetting that is for israel now theres action towards taking raqqa by the kurds and who knows who else the us and its posse will provide the air cover and logistics plus lots of special ops once it kicks in im surprised the kurds bit again after taking it up the arse from the us a couple of months ago theyre not going all in right now as things are ongoing in mosul and will be for a while but you dont hear assad and the russians squawking much about it its like they both know that parts of eastern syria are byebye trumps good will towards russia certainly doesnt extend to iran and no american will ever call hezbollah anything bur a terrorist organization after the marine barracks truck bombing in beirut all those years ago if putin and trump are going to come to a general understanding in the me theres going to have to be some give and take putins done quite a turnaround in taking russia from a pariah state a couple of years ago to the player on the world sage that it is now its looking good for him to keep his man in power in syria and to establish a permanent presence in the me with khmeimim and tartus once trump is fully up to

38,38,Democrat Gutierrez Blames Chicagos Gun Violence on NRA  Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,Rep Luis Gutierrez    made the rounds on MSBNC and CNN dismissing President Donald Trumps offer to help Chicago end gun violence and blaming the NRA for the death and mayhem currently marring the Windy City Gutierrez was reacting to Trumps description of the carnage in Chicago and his pledge to intervene federally if city leaders fail to stop the violence On January 24 Trump tweeted  If Chicago doesnt fix the horrible carnage going on 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings up 24 from 2016 I will send in the Feds     Donald J Trump realDonaldTrump January 25 2017  The following day Gutierrez appeared on All In With Chris Hayes and said President Trump tweets about the carnage and that hes going to send the feds in Did he send any extra money for police officers We could use that for training  He noted that Trump is increasing the number of Border Patrol agents on the southern border and said Chicago would like to have more federal agents   ATF and FBI   in the city as well Then Gutierrez said But      President Trump is with the NRA The NRA that endorsed him that is      so part of his relationship You know that NRA did It crippled the laws of the city of Chicago and the courts so that we cannot keep guns off our streets The next day Gutierrez appeared on CNN where he was again asked about Trumps carnage assessment and his pledge to send in the feds if Chicago city leaders fail to end the violence Gutierrez said Heres the hypocrisy of it all The fact is Donald Trump loves the NRA And during his campaign he embraced them and they embraced him The city of Chicago had some of the most stringent gun control laws how were they eviscerated Because the NRA funded lawsuits against our gun control measures Gutierrez ignores the fact that Chicago had some its highest annual murder rates while all the citys gun controls were place For example the Chicago Police Department reports 921 murders during 1991 940 during 1992 850 during 2993 and 930 during 1994 These excessively high murder numbers all occurred while Chicagos ban on handgun ownership was in place Viewed in this light the 762 murders CNN reported for 2016 were a far cry from some of the murder numbers witnessed while Chicagos most stringent gun controls were in effect AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment

39,39,Avoiding Peanuts to Avoid an Allergy Is a Bad Strategy for Most  The New York Times,Aaron E Carroll,This article originally ran in April We are resurfacing it in light of new guidelines from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that advise giving peanuts to children early and often as a strategy to forestall an allergy  It has become an article of faith among many women I know to eliminate some foods during pregnancy out of concern that their children could become allergic to them shellfish dairy and most of all peanuts After their babies arrive they continue to abstain from certain foods while   and they certainly keep their children from eating them But research in the last few years has consistently shown that all this avoidance often does more harm than good In many cases we need to be doing the opposite Mothers didnt adopt this behavior out of nowhere In 2000 the American Academy of Pediatrics released guidelines on reducing a childs risk for developing allergies They recommended that mothers eliminate peanuts and tree nuts e g almonds walnuts etc and consider eliminating eggs cows milk fish and perhaps other foods from their diets while nursing  Further they recommended that children at high risk for allergies be given no solid foods until six months of age no dairy products until 1 year old no eggs until age 2 and no peanuts nuts or fish until age 3 A debate has been raging in the health care system for decades on this topic I was part of a systematic review that examined the relationship between early solid food introduction and allergic disease in children We found no good evidence to support the idea that being exposed to solid foods earlier led to persistent food allergies To its credit the A A P changed its recommendations based on new research In 2008 updated guidelines reported that maternal restrictions in pregnancy or   no longer seemed like advice that should be widely recommended It also acknowledged that there didnt seem much reason to delay the introduction of allergy foods like peanuts after six months around the age babies move from milk or formula to a wider range of food Unfortunately this did little to change peoples behavior Many had already internalized the advice It seemed logical to them that avoiding foods would give children less of a chance to develop allergies If it was still a good idea not to expose children until they were six months old why not keep going A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine last year turned all of this on its head Researchers enrolled 640 infants at high risk for allergies between 4 and 11 months of age in a trial and randomized them to one of two groups One of them was to avoid peanut protein the other was to eat at least six grams of peanut protein a week given in three or more meals All participants were followed until they were 5 years old What was most surprising in this work was that 15 percent of the infants already had evidence of peanut sensitivity by allergy testing They were enrolled in the trial despite this and half of them were given peanut extract every week The results were remarkable At the end of the study about 3 percent of those exposed to peanuts had developed a peanut allergy compared with more than 17 percent among those who avoided peanuts More surprising if you looked just at the children who already had evidence of peanut sensitivity when they were babies fewer than 11 percent of those regularly exposed to peanuts developed an allergy But more than 35 percent of those who avoided peanuts developed an allergy Children who had proven sensitivity to peanuts but consumed them in their diet regularly were less likely to develop a peanut allergy than children without sensitivity who avoided them Recently   results were published After the trial ended researchers asked all the participants who had been regularly consuming peanuts to avoid them for the next 12 months At the end of that period when the children were 6 there was no significant increase in new peanut allergies in that group Avoidance at this point made no difference The critical need for exposure appears to be somewhere from infancy until age 5 These results were so convincing that once again experts are changing their recommendations In September 2015 the A A P     along with others     argued that health care providers should recommend introducing   products into the diets of   infants early on in life  These changes dovetail nicely within what has become known as the hygiene hypothesis the gist of which is that as weve made our environment more and more sterile our immune systems develop differently than they used to Without exposure to outside things to fight our defenses turn inward and toward more benign substances leading to increased levels of eczema asthma and allergies Of course many people used to die from infections that no longer threaten us because of advances so no one should take this as a call for living in filth Nor should anyone take these recent findings as advice to feed babies and small children peanuts and other foods without concern All changes to an infants diet especially in children with allergies should be done in consultation with a health care professional As with many things in health care however we went too far

40,40,MRI Shows Detailed Images of 20Week Unborn Babies  Breitbart,Dr Susan Berry,A newly developed MRI scan allows parents to see detailed images of the beating heart of even a   unborn baby as well as clear pictures of the baby stretching its legs and even swallowing in the womb The new scan developed by a   team of medical researchers could replace the somewhat grainy ultrasound images parents are more accustomed to viewing during pregnancy  UK video parenting site ChannelMum is sharing the video created by the iFind project which shows an MRI scan of a baby at 20 weeks Cathy Ranson who edits the site says Scans are amazing as they help mums dads and even other family members bond with their baby     There is nothing quite as emotional as seeing your unborn child moving inside you and these MRI scans are taking images to the next level she adds They are truly breathtaking  According to the Daily Mail the new scan is also revving up the abortion debate in the UK once again since with the new technology parents and doctors can see clearly how fully formed an unborn baby is at 20 weeks Currently the legal abortion limit in the UK is 24 weeks Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has previously supported slashing the limit to 12 weeks and there have also been calls to reduce it to 20 weeks says the report With a   administration now in the White House in the United States national leaders who oppose abortion are hoping to pass the   Unborn Child Protection Act which would ban most abortions past the   mark into law Dr David Lloyd a clinical research fellow at Kings College London who has participated in the project says Taking pictures of a 20 week fetus while theyre still in the womb really isnt that easy  He explains For one thing theyre very small The fetal heart for example with all of its tiny chambers and valves is only about 15mm long less than the size of penny Ultrasound technology     used in all routine antenatal scans in the UK     is actually fairly good at visualising these tiny structures It uses very high frequency sound waves which are reflected back echo from the structures inside the body to produce an image The MRI scan unlike an ultrasound shows what is happening under the babys skin so that images can be obtained even of babies who move around frequently In fetal ultrasound the images produced can be excellent but unfortunately thats not true for every patient Lloyd continues Ultrasound has to be able to see through the body to the parts of the baby we want to image and that isnt always easy It will depend on the age of the baby how they are lying in the womb the size of the mother and many other factors  MRI which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images isnt so limited he explains It can see the structures inside the body regardless of whether theres bone muscle or fat in the way and in some cases it can give us even more detailed images than ultrasound  Importantly it is also one of the few

41,41,4 of the Best Kinds of Milk That Arent Dairy,Alexandria Laredo,  Now numerous studies have concluded that milk doesnt actually build bone and provide the same amount of calcium that we thought A study published in the British Medical Journal  for example followed more than 100000 people in Sweden over periods of 20 to 30 years with shocking results The people who drank milk were more likely to die from heart disease and cancer The women suffered more overall fractures and hip fractures as well Different studies have also shown that higher dairy intake is linked to higher risks of prostate and ovarian cancer and can trigger type 1 diabetes It is also linked to forms of acne just to name a few effects There is also the disturbing side of the dairy industry where animals are abused to produce the milk we drink A lot of dairy products are filled with the hormones that were given to female cows to keep them perpetually lactating so they produce an endless flow of milk This doctor describes it perfectly when he says cows milk is for baby calfs just like human milk is for babies It is a substance we need while in crucial stages of development but past a certain age it becomes obsolete While there are many alternatives to dairy milk some are much better than others Here are some of the better milk products out there Almond Milk Raw organic almond milk is a great choice when you know where its coming from As with many mass produced products even some almond milks arent the best for us An analysis of a UK almond milk brand showed that nuts make up only 2 of the drink itself A single serving of almond milk has almost no protein Compared with plain old almonds it fares even worse There is one place where almond milk comes out on top of course It has more potassium and more of the vitamins A and D But almond milk is fortified with these nutrients  theyve been added during the production process Making almond milk yourself however is a fantastic option and allows you to control exactly what goes inside it ensuring there are no additives preservatives or substances youve never even heard of before Rice Milk Rice milk is another good choice that works well as a dairy substitute if you dont mind the taste Its higher in carbohydrates than other milk choices and contains around the same amount of calcium as cows milk Yet it contains almost no protein so it needs to be balanced with other protein rich foods During processing the carbs break down into sugars and give the milk a sweet taste It is filled with more sugar around 10 grams for one serving which is a lot more than something like coconut milk which has around 3 grams If youre trying to have as little sugar as possible rice milk may not be the best choice but its certainly better than plain old dairy milk Coconut Milk Coconut milk is definitely one of the healthier options here When this milk is all natural meaning theres no added sugars natural flavours or preservatives it is incredibly healthy for us  Coconuts are highly nutritious and rich in fibre vitamins C E B1 B3 B5 and B6 and minerals including iron selenium sodium calcium magnesium and phosphorous The things that makes coconuts so good is the type of fat they contain They have a form of mediumchain fatty acids rather than longchain fatty acids which are stored in our tissue for much longer One of the beneficial acids within coconuts is called lauric acid This gets converted inside the body into a beneficial substance called monolaurin acid which acts as an antiviral agent But unlike other milks if you have access you can go right up to a coconut tree and drink the milk straight from the coconut without the need for processing This is one of the most pure and fresh ways to get some milk in you Hemp Milk Ah hemp one of the most versatile plants on our planet Hemp milk has a wide range of health benefits that a lot of other milks dont Some companies make fully organic nonGMO and unsweetened hemp milk but its always good to check exactly where youre getting your products from Hemp milk has a more beanlike and nutty flavor to it which still tastes great in many drinks or foods Its also

42,42,Ryan Lochte Dropped by Speedo USA and Other Retailers  The New York Times,Katie Rogers,The fallout from Ryan Lochtes story about being robbed at gunpoint in Rio     a tale the Brazilian police said was not true     continued Monday when four companies said they would end business partnerships with Mr Lochte an American swimmer and   Olympic medalist After a week of intense international media attention and anger in Brazil the financial repercussions were swift for Mr Lochte as Speedo USA the luxury clothing retailer Ralph Lauren and the mattress company Airweave all announced that they would part ways with him And Syneron Candela a company that sells   devices told Reuters its relationship with the swimmer ended on Sunday Speedo USA said in a message on Twitter that it would instead donate a 50 000 portion of Mr Lochtes fee to a charity to help Brazilian children While we have enjoyed a winning relationship with Ryan for over a decade and he has been an important member of the Speedo team we cannot condone behavior that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for the company said in its statement On Monday Kim Angelastro a spokeswoman for Syneron Candela wrote in an email We hold our employees to high standards and we expect the same of our business partners  Mr Lochte was a spokesman for the companys Gentle Hair Removal brand Through a spokeswoman Ralph Lauren said Monday that Mr Lochtes endorsement agreement with the clothing company had been for only the 2016 Olympics and that his contract would not be renewed Airweave said on Twitter that after careful consideration we have made the decision to end our partnership with Ryan Lochte  The decisions to cut ties with Mr Lochte 32 were the first major signs of the financial fallout for him

fabricated the account of being robbed after a   party in Rio de Janeiro The authorities said that the swimmers had instead drunkenly vandalized a gas station bathroom paying a security guard about 50 for the damage before leaving Mr Lochte originally said that the car they were traveling in had been stopped by armed men who held a gun to his head But his story later changed A Brazilian judge ordered the swimmers to remain in Rio but Mr Lochte had already left the country After Mr Conger and Mr Bentz were pulled from their flight to the United States they told the police that the confrontation began when Lochte pulled a poster off a gas station wall Mr Feigen 26 later donated 10 800 to a charity in Rio that teaches martial arts to poor children Mr Lochte first issued an apology on social media     I should have been much more responsible for how I handled myself he wrote     then told Matt Lauer in an interview on NBC that he had been intoxicated and that he had overexaggerated that story  He has maintained that he was held at gunpoint All we know is that there was a gun pointed in our direction and we were demanded to give money Mr Lochte said Mr Lochte whose boyish and sometimes oafish personality had made him a commercial success in Olympics past had headed into Rio with fewer sponsors than hed had at the London Games according to a report by CNN

45,45,Internal Inquiry Sealed the Fate of Roger Ailes at Fox  The New York Times,Jim Rutenberg Ben Protess and Emily Steel,Executives at 21st Century Fox decided to end the tenure of Roger Ailes after lawyers they hired to investigate an allegation of sexual harassment against him took statements from at least six other women who described inappropriate behavior from Mr Ailes two people briefed on the inquiry said Wednesday One of the people said that the details of the allegations while unverified were troubling enough that they left 21st Century Fox little choice but to force an end to Mr Ailess reign as chairman and chief executive of Fox News given the potential liability they presented to the company both legally and in terms of its own corporate culture The people with knowledge of the state of discussions over Mr Ailess exit agreement said both sides were working toward an accommodation that would recognize Mr Ailess service to the company as the founder and leader of Fox News which sits atop the cable news ratings and is a major profit engine for 21st Century Fox The agreement could also include a provision for him to continue with Fox as a consultant But given the personalities and complications involved the situation was fluid enough that no accommodation had been reached by Wednesday night Fox News did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the discussions or on the investigation which is being conducted by the law firm Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton  Garrison Lawyers for Mr Ailes did not respond to requests for comment Mr Ailes has denied the allegations of sexual harassment and more than a dozen Fox News staff members including some top stars have publicly supported him The people briefed on the investigation who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity of the investigation stressed that it was narrowly focused on the allegations against Mr Ailes and not the broader climate at the network But Mr Ailess departure will have much wider implications Given Fox Newss place as a central hub for conservative opinion     not to mention as a primary outlet for the Republican nominee for president Donald J Trump     the shape of its   operation goes beyond corporate intrigue at 21st Century Fox and could have consequences for the national political dialogue In the two weeks since Gretchen Carlson a former Fox anchor filed suit against Mr Ailes the Murdoch family which runs 21st Century Fox has made it clear that its decision to take the allegations seriously was in keeping with its desire to follow modern standards for office conduct and that these needed to extend to Fox News as well The question in the   environment is to what extent the Murdochs decide to continue on with Mr Ailess current management team That in turn could determine the future approach and look of the network which is the outlet of choice for   viewers seeking an alternative to the mainstream media Speculation about who Mr Ailess successor would be transfixed the media world on Wednesday with focus on outsiders such as the CBS News president David Rhodes who had worked at Fox News for several years one of Mr Ailess current lieutenants like Bill Shine or Michael Clemente the New York Post chief executive Jesse Angelo or someone from conservative media like Christopher Ruddy the founder and chief executive of Newsmax Media Inc At least for the day fears that some of Fox Newss   stars like Bill OReilly Sean Hannity and Greta Van Susteren would exercise contract clauses to leave with Mr Ailess loss of his chairmanship appeared to abate Network staff members were acutely focused on Megyn Kelly who had hinted in recent months she wanted to leave the network She was one of the women who told Paul Weiss investigators that Mr Ailes had acted improperly with her one of the people briefed on the inquiry said Tuesday Ms Kelly maintained her silence on Wednesday But as the end of Mr Ailess chairmanship approached it appeared to embolden other women to discuss their own experiences at the network Several spoke with reporters on condition that they not be named In interviews several current and former Fox News employees said inappropriate comments about a womans appearance and her sex life were frequent in the newsroom The newsroom has been on edge in the weeks since Ms Carlson filed her suit one person said Everybody wants to talk about the drama but nobody wants to talk in the open the person said As of Wednesday evening staff members had not received an email from 21st Century Fox Fox News or Mr Ailes informing them about the events that have transpired the investigation or the future of the network The swift pace of events at Fox News     only two weeks passed between Ms Carlsons filing of her lawsuit and the negotiations to end Mr Ailess leadership     were especially surprising for a network that has made its name by embracing politically incorrect themes something in keeping with the brash personalities of both Mr Ailes and the 21st Century Fox patriarch Rupert Murdoch Female hosts in skirts sitting behind translucent desks that can highlight their legs have always been a network trademark To completely move away from that ethos would be to fundamentally change the network And 21st Century Foxs leadership will have to be mindful of maintaining its special relationship with viewers that Mr Ailes has so carefully cultivated and which is central to the financial and ratings success of the network Mr Murdoch will ultimately determine that direction in close consultation     and perhaps even some deference     to the two sons he is grooming to succeed him Lachlan and James Murdoch The latter at least is known to have different politics from his father So far none of the three has made any public statement about the network its future or for that matter Mr Ailes,0,executives at 21st century fox decided to end the tenure of roger ailes after

46,46,Press TV Debate Duff on Lebanon Hezbollah and Aouns Presidency 3 videos,Gordon Duff Senior Editor,"By Gordon Duff Senior Editor on November 2 2016 Understanding Lebanon and the political realignment there critical to US understanding of the regionand to our future with Israel 
Lebanon has a new president The political development puts an end to over two years of power vacuum in the country On Monday lawmakers voted to pick General Michel Aoun as Lebanons 13th president The election is seen as a victory for the resistance movement Hezbollah especially after Saad Hariri the leader of the March 14 Alliance and a close ally of Saudi Arabia voiced his support for Aoun On this edition of The Debate Press TV has asked two analysts why they believe Hariri threw his weight behind Aoun 
Nabil Mikhail a professor at The George Washington University praised Hariris measure adding that with this decision he actually wanted to bring stability back to Lebanon and thus avoid Syrias spillover effects 
Hariri is a shrewd politician who represents an important segment of the Lebanese society Mikhail said adding that by his vote for General Aoun he aimed to take the country out of the current political deadlock and ultimately save it from the repercussions of the Syrian war 
Mikhail believes that the United States shrinking power in the Middle East has forced Hariri to face away from Washington 
I believe that Saad Hariri could have been motivated along with others about a vision that Americas role in the Middle East is receding So perhaps Russia is the new reality in the Middle East is a new power So anything that is somehow close to Russia will be better for Lebanon Mikhail argued 
Mikhail said that so many things have transpired inside Lebanon and inside the Arab region within this year I would assume that the Syrian civil war and its severity and brutality has convinced him that he can maintain good ties with the Persian Gulf states but at the same time study the strategic realities 
He Hariri sees that Syria has to be stable in order for Lebanon to be stable So he is making calculations I hope none of them is a miscalculation because the area cannot afford any other catastrophe So he displayed again very well maintaining some sort of balance between his Syrian interests and Persian Gulf interests and perhaps he can formulate some equilibrium about this The image grab shows Gordon Duff L a senior editor of Veterans Today based in Ohio and Nabil Mikhail a professor at The George Washington University at Press TVs The Debate show on Monday night 
Meanwhile the other guest on the show Gordon Duff the editor of Veterans Today  noted that in his view the reason behind Hezbollahs victory in Michel Aouns election is the movements victories in Syria especially in Aleppo which has made it more powerful than ever and has paved the way for domestic victories 
If Aleppo falls and Aleppo will fall its only a matter of how long a victorious and highlydisciplined highlytrained Hezbollah force which is heavily trained by Russia and by Iran is going to return to Lebanon Its a very different force and I believe Hariri is looking at this Reaching out for what should be a very different Hezbollah could lead to stabilization of the political process in Lebanon

50,50,Sparking An Inner Revolution,Lance Schuttler,0 0 With humanitys awakening continuing to speed up as every day passes we see more and more people desiring information to help them better themselves Whether that is done through eating healthier foods beginning a yoga or meditation practice or whether it is done by being more mindful with the words they choose to use when having an inner dialogue or a conversation with friends and family more people are looking for information to help them transform their lives in a positive way While there are many methods to improving ones life below are some methods that can help a person spark an inner revolution to create positive and uplifting change in his or her world GroundingEarthing Grounding or what is also called Earthing is when a person has bare skin touching the Earth or a tree and is most commonly done by standing on the Earth with ones bare feet Doing this begins to balance the electrochemical state of the body because of the negative ions the Earth emits Negative ions act as antioxidants freeradical scavengers by pairing up with the free radicals and rendering them neutral Thus pain inflammation and anything out of balance begins to move towards balance or homeostasis There have been several studies that have shown how grounding helps with pain reduction wounding healing balancing of the circadian rhythm to help improve sleep as well as helping to shift a persons brainwaves to the alpha state which is great for a calm and balanced yet alert and fully awake state of mind Standing barefoot on the Earth sand dirt or concrete not asphalt will allow the free flow of negative ions to come in contact with the sensory neurons on the skin and begin to trigger positive physiological and psychological changes within the body Taking it a bit further if a person is able to connect with the Earth in a quiet place the benefits could be even more as Dr Joe Dispenza has said  In clinical studies we have proven that 2 hours of nature sounds a day significantly reduce stress hormones up to 800 and activates 500600 DNA segments known to be responsible for healing and repairing the body Burning Sage In a 2007 study from the Journal of Ethnopharmacology  researchers found that medicinal smoke killed harmful airborne bacteria by up to 94 in just one hour On a more spiritual level burning sage has long been used to clear negative or disharmonious energies from a space This can be done when a person comes home from work or school for that day as burning sage can be a good way to clear any discordant energy the person may have picked up or had taken on from other people or their environment It is used to clear away such energy so that a person can be centered in who he or she is rather than having to deal with issues that might have been taken on from others I personally do this each time after coming home from getting groceries or running and errand Essential Oils The two best ways to use essential oils are to smell them as well as apply them to the skin While applying essential oils to the skin has many of its own benefits smelling them also creates wonderful responses in the body and especially the brain According to the University of Minnesota  smelling essential oils molecules affect the olfactory organs the lungs and thus the respiratory system as well as the brain Odor molecules travel through the nose and positively affect the limbic system of the brain which is sometimes called the emotional part of the brain To this end the limbic system controls heart rate mood blood pressure memory breathing stress hormone response and overall stress levels Applying or smelling essential oils throughout the day is a wonderful way to develop emotional intelligence and can help a person respond to stressful situations in a more positive way than before Smelling essential oils can be personally described as an uplifting and heavenly experience one that allows us to smell the cosmic byproduct of thousands of flowers pressed into a wonderful gift for humanity Breathing Exercises Breathing exercises which can also be considered a form of meditation can have profound effects on the body and mind According to Deepok Chopra  a regular practice of rhythmic deep breathing has been shown to reduce anxiety and depression stabilize blood pressure increase energy levels and decrease feelings of stress Over time a breathing or meditation practice can lead to wonderful internal shifts both physically and emotionally Incorporating a deep breathing practice into the practice of grounding or Earthing is a great way to accomplish both practices at once Here is an article of three sample breathing exercises from Dr Andrew Weil While there are many other practices a person can use to help catalyze deeper inner growth such as flower essence therapy different from essential oils nature walking sunbathing and the use of certain health supplements like fulvic acid and Reishi  this list is a guide that may help those who may just be starting to experience an internal transformation These four simple practices can be easy to incorporate into ones life and is recommended to experiment with what feels best for that person What of these practices do you use in your life What other practices do you use to help you continue

55,55,The Trump Election Will Spark More Individual  Collective Healing,Lance Schuttler,"The Trump Election Will Spark More Individual  Collective Healing Nov 9 2016 1 0 
This article will not be a proTrump or a proHillary piece It will have little to do with politics and more to do with a much bigger picture As everyone knows many people are celebrating the Trump victory and many people are mourning it What is needed right now is a wider perspective at what is occurring Donald Trump will become the next US President 
With Donald Trump set to take over the Oval Office in late January of 2017 there are many unknowns just as it would be if Hillary would have won 
What is going to happen with health insurance What is going to happen with immigration laws What is going to happen with foreign policy in relation to other nations More importantly what is going to happen to us as individuals and humanity as a whole 
Individual Healing 
While these questions need to be asked and will in time be answered we must remember that we cannot give up our personal power to shape our individual lives Right now many people are worried and many people are thrilled Regardless of our feelings on this election we must remember that we alone are responsible for our individual lives as we make countless choices each day How will I choose to treat others today How will I choose to treat myself today Am I taking care of my physical body well by eating well and exercising enough Am I ensuring to get enough sleep throughout the week What is it I can do today to become a better person By either believing that one person is going to save or change your entire life or by believing that one person is going to ruin your entire life gives away your own personal power The great philosopher Epictetus once said  It is not what happens to you it is how you respond We always have a choice in our response to any situation 
By either being saddened or thrilled at the perception that one man is going to either ruin or save your life is extremely disempowering Though each person has every right to feel how they want it must be remembered where true power comes from within  Every person has the choice how they wish to respond to this election Are you going to wither away in frustration anger and despair or are you going to make choices that help you to become the best person you can be On the opposite side are you going to sit back and believe your personal challenges are going to be fixed with a new president or are you also going to take action to become the best person you can be Regardless of who you did or didnt support we all need to reclaim our personal power and continue the trek towards bettering and healing ourselves even if it is in the smallest of ways 
Collective Healing 
On a wider scale this election will give us the collective choice to where we wish to travel Do we wish to seek peace with other people and other countries Do we wish to have dialogue with nations previous administrations demonized Do we wish to communicate with and try to understand other peoples viewpoints or are we going to remain closed off to such opportunities for personal and collective healing and growth 
Additionally are we going to continue to allow groupthink to dominate our society by letting the media tell us what to believe or are we going to begin gathering information from several sources to arrive at our own conclusions Are we going to question our leaders more and demand answers that are truthful and unbiased towards any specific agenda Will we do this both on a local and mass level Are we going to work towards cooperation or continue to live in a dying paradigm of competition 
As physicist and author Gregg Braden says  A growing body of scientific evidence gathered from more than 400 peerreviewed studies is leading to an undeniable truth violent competition and war directly contradict our deepest instincts of cooperation and nurturing Scientific studies show conclusively that nature is based upon a model of cooperation and mutual aid not violent competition and war We live in a world where everything is connected We can no longer think in terms of us and them when it comes to the consequences of the way we live Today its all about WE  Science has disproved Darwins theory and shows us we must act in unison to transcend our collective challenges 
I see this election as many other do a massive turning point in our worlds evolution I personally have full trust that we will look back at this time and see this as a positive yet challenging event in that it empowered more people to begin taking action to create the kind of world they wish to live in This turning point is allowing us all to shift our perception of the world and to initiate action towards creating a more peaceful happy and abundant world for all

 At a time of politics of fear Jaan Islam counters fear with knowledge in his masterpiece True Islam Jihad and Terrorism Nova Science Publishers New York 2016 During the 2016 US election it has become clear world peace and security is connected to the state of Islam and how it is understood in todays context This is a very timely book that fills a gap in the western society about Islamic history philosophy and political science This book presents the Islamic political philosophy as represented in the writings of great Muslim thinkers and scholars such as Ibn Khaldun Jaan Islam uses the socalled Islamic cognition technique and starts the book with a chapter dedicated to Islamic cognition This chapter on cognition itself is a paradigm shift in the modern research scholarship and can be considered for advancing knowledge in other fields Such an extension was first pointed by Islam Zatzman and Islam 2013 in their groundbreaking work on educational curriculum
MORE Stop using millenary religions as a scapegoat for the crimes of Modern Imperialism Another Ramadan for Muslims amid sufferings A conversation on equality integration and Islam as a religious marker An open letter to young Muslims everywhere The seed of triumph in every adversity Following the tradition of early Islamic scholars Jaan Islam presented all theories in the book with evidence from the primary Islamic sources Quran and authenticated traditions of the prophet  These sources were completely ignored in the in the Orientalist now it has morphed into neoOrientalism writings which led to the inundation of the post 911 world with disinformation and agendadriven research about Islamic history The distinction between this book and these agendadriven ones gives the book a special value
 Although the book explains the Islamic foundations of political science and governance it should not be looked at as a book of theology It is a dogmafree approach that has been characterized as truly scientific elsewhere  Quite appropriately the author starts off with a brilliant narration of Islamic cognition It has been all but forgotten in the west that Islam is the religion that started the tradition of dogmafree truly scientific cognition The west does recognize Averröes the famous Islamic scholar as the father of secular philosophy whereas brands Islam as just another religion similar to Christianity infected with doctrinal philosophy It is no surprise that with that starting point Islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the west
Chapter 3 of the book deals with fundamental philosophies of three major philosophers namely Hobbes Locke and Ibn Khaldun In this chapter the author debunks another myth that is Ibn Khalduns political theory is somehow similar to those of Hobbes and Locke Ibn Khaldun the father of social science indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition The author points out how Ibn Khalduns first premise was Shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using Quran as the origin and prophet Muhammads life through the book of Hadith as the pivotal point One the other hand Locke had placed himself as the pivotal point whereas Hobbes eliminated any cognition point The author makes it clear that both Hobbes and Lockes cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition In my researched opinion this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic It is because the eastern authors do not know about Hobbes and Locke and the western authors do not know about Islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with Ibn Khaldun
In Chapter 4 the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly guided caliphs known as Rashedun Caliphs Clearly the authors intention is to understand how the prophet and his closest followers went to war or which verses of the Quran they were enacting For the first time anyone took this approach and not surprisingly the author comes up with four rigid criteria from the Quran No other author to the best of my knowledge connected them to specific wars that the prophet and his companions engaged in This finding helps the author establish jus ad bellum that can explain every war that shaped the foundation of the young Islamic state of the time
Similar to Chapter 4 the author discovers jus ad bello in Islamic jurisprudence in Chapter 5 Once again the case laws are presented and analyzed in such a manner one can take any new example and evaluate it to call it permissible or not The theoretical basis for critiquing any modern warfare is set in this chapter
In Chapter 6 the author addresses a difficult topic When is it allowed or even mandatory to rebel against a head of state It is often stated that Islam is a complete code of life The author makes it clear that Islam didnt leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time The important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary This is not an easy topic to cover even in todays world The author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary The history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided Caliphate the victors were no longer rightly guided The author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership This chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of Islam that has spent lifetime on the topic
Often when Islamic criteria are discussed eyes roll and eye brows furrow in disbelief If it is all that simple why dont Islamic scholars have consensus The author handles this topic like a pro In Chapter 7 he analyzes current Islamic scholars and deconstructs their thought process He has kind words for some but has nothing but scorn for the selfrighteous apologist scholars that have done great disservice to Islam andor scientific cognition process One doesnt have to be personal but the writing is so clear one can hardly afford to not get angry at certain genre of scholars To anyones surprise this list is not made out of antiIslamic nonMuslim scholars
Chapter 8 is where proof of the pudding appears The author analyzes every major event of todays political arena and analyzes it with the Islamic criteria of both jus ad bello and jus ad bellum The author comes up with an index to rank various countries and groups Most interesting is the discussion on current US allies such as Saudi Arabia and how they rank among the biggest offenders of Islam and Islamic laws This is not a topic for the faint of heart but the author did an excellent job making it easily readable punctuated with numerous riveting arguments
Chapter 9 is the conclusion and recommendation I have studied Islam for some 30 years and yet I found these conclusions novel and entirely logical I doubt anyone would agree with the conclusions unless of course that person reads the entire book prior to reading the conclusion It is important to read the book in sequence
Chapter 10 lists the bibliography and references It is many pages long and is quite comprehensive
Chapter 11 is the Appendix that lists the letters of the prophet It is a great idea to give the letters in original Arabic so there is no room for misinterpretation let alone disinformation
Anyone with knowledge of Islam knows that Jihad is in the core of Islam and this book shows it is so and there needs to be no apology Quite interestingly the author even depicts Jihad as the roof of Islam Without the roof the Fort of Islam has no protection whatsoever This depiction captures the essence of protection security as well as integrity and puts away the notion of Jihad being a weapon for Crusade like aggression
This book belongs to the desk of any researcher interested in knowing about Islam or what Islam can do to bring about peace on earth in order to live out the true meaning of the word Islam that means peace through submission to the creator This book is equally useful for anyone interested in pursuit of peace and harmony that is truly elusive in todays world In this sense this book is a manual for

myth that is ibn khalduns political theory is somehow similar to those of hobbes and locke ibn khaldun the father of social science indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition the author points out how ibn khalduns first premise was shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using quran as the origin and prophet muhammads life through the book of hadith as the pivotal point one the other hand locke had placed himself as the pivotal point whereas hobbes eliminated any cognition point the author makes it clear that both hobbes and lockes cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition in my researched opinion this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic it is because the eastern authors do not know about hobbes and locke and the western authors do not know about islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with ibn khaldun in chapter 4 the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly

rebel against a head of state it is often stated that islam is a complete code of life the author makes it clear that islam didnt leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time the important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary this is not an easy topic to cover even in todays world the author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary the history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided caliphate the victors were no longer rightly guided the author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership this chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of islam

58,58,If Donald Trump Wins The Election It Will Be The Biggest Miracle In US Political History,The Doc,"If Donald Trump Wins The Election It Will Be The Biggest Miracle In US Political History Posted on Home  Headlines  World News  If Donald Trump Wins The Election It Will Be The Biggest Miracle In US Political History 
Are we about to see the largest election day miracle of all time 

From Michael Snyder  
Because as I will show in this article that is precisely what it is going to take in order for Donald Trump to win Before I go any further I want to make it exceedingly clear that I am not saying what the outcome will be on November 8th As I recently told a national television audience I do not know who is going to win 
In this article I am simply going to examine the poll numbers and the electoral map as they currently stand But in this bizarre election things can literally change overnight and it is entirely possible that we could still have another October surprise or two before it is all said and done And without a doubt Donald Trump desperately needs something to move the needle because if the election was held today Hillary Clinton would almost certainly win 
What we have witnessed so far during the 2016 election season has been absolutely unprecedented Just consider some of the things that we have seen up to this point in time 
We have never had a bigger October surprise than the release of the lewd audio tape from 11 years ago in which Donald Trump claimed to grope women without their consent 
We have never seen the mainstream media openly attack a presidential candidate as much as they have attacked Donald Trump In the past the big mainstream news outlets at least pretended to be fair and balanced but this year they have completely discarded all notions of objectivity 
They should be completely and utterly ashamed of themselves and no matter who wins the election they will never be able to get their integrity back 
We have also never seen a major party at war with itself this close to a presidential election It has been said that a house divided against itself will surely fall and a whole host of prominent Republican leaders have been openly attempting to sabotage the Trump campaign 
If Donald Trump is able to overcome all of these factors it truly will be a miracle of Biblical proportions 
As it stands at the moment however the numbers are looking quite ominous for Trump Right now the Real Clear Politics average of national polls has Hillary Clinton ahead by 62 percent Most political experts consider that to be an insurmountable lead at this stage in the game 
But even if Trump can close that gap and pull ahead that does not mean that he will win the election In fact Trump could beat Clinton by millions of votes nationally and still lose 
In order to win the election one candidate has got to get to 270 electoral votes And on the latest Real Clear Politics electoral map 262 electoral votes are being projected to go to Hillary Clinton 164 electoral votes are being projected to go to Donald Trump and 112 electoral votes are in the toss up category 
So unless something dramatically changes Donald Trump is essentially going to have to run the table in all of the closely contested states in order to win and the mathematical odds of that happening are extremely slim 
Lets take a closer look at this The first thing that Donald Trump is going to have to do in order to get to 270 electoral votes is to win all of the states that Mitt Romney won in 2012 That would get him up to 206 electoral votes 
Unfortunately it looks like that may be very difficult to do Romney won North Carolina but the six most recent polls all have Clinton ahead in that state Romney also won Arizona but the most recent poll to be taken there has Clinton ahead by five points 
But for a moment lets assume that Trump can win all of the states that Romney won On top of that there are four other states that Trump must win 
1 Trump must win Floridas 29 electoral votes Without Florida Trump has no realistic path to 270 electoral votes So on election night if it is announced that Trump has lost Florida you might as well turn off your television and go to bed because Trump is going to lose the election 
Unfortunately for Trump four recent major surveys all show Trump down by four points in the Sunshine state 
2 Trump must win Ohios 18 electoral votes No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio and the two most recent major surveys show that Trump and Clinton are tied in the state 
3 Trump must win Iowas 6 electoral votes Fortunately for Trump most recent surveys show him actually leading in Iowa 
4 Trump must win Nevadas 6 electoral votes At this point that is looking like it will be very tough to do because all of the recent polls have Clinton leading in Nevada including the most recent one that has her up by 7 points 
If Donald Trump can win those four states that still does not get him to 270 electoral votes Instead it gets him to 265 electoral votes and so he would still need one more mediumsized state to win 
The most likely candidates for that last state are Pennsylvania Michigan Wisconsin or Minnesota Unfortunately for Trump Clinton appears to have big leads in all four of those states right at this moment 
But even if Trump can somehow pull off a miracle and squeak past the 270 electoral vote mark the truth is that Utah could still mess everything up 
Do you remember Evan McMullin 
He was the third party conservative alternative candidate that was hyped for a couple of days but that seemingly fell off the map afterwards 
He is only on the ballot in 12 states but one of those states is Utah and it turns out that Evan McMullin is a Mormon 
Many Mormons believe that a Mormon will be elected president someday when the US Constitution hangs like a thread According to this belief this Mormon president will turn the country around and all sorts of wonderful things will start to happen Many Mormons thought that Mitt Romney was going to be this president but now Evan McMullin has become the target of these expectations 
So how in the world could Evan McMullin become president 
Well their plan is to have Evan McMullin win Utah and that could potentially keep both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton from both getting to 270 electoral votes if the election is super close If that happens the election would be thrown into the House of Representatives 
It is being projected that the House will still be controlled by the Republicans after this election and so the choice would come down to either Trump or McMullin and those backing McMullin believe that he would have a realistic shot in that scenario 
I know all of this sounds very strange but this is actually being discussed around family dinner tables all over Utah tonight 
And in recent days Evan McMullin has been soaring in Utah One recent survey shows Trump with a one point lead over McMullin and another recent survey actually show McMullin leading Trump by four points in the state 
So Trump could pull off a miracle and do everything else that he needs to do to get to 270 electoral votes and Utah could end up messing up everything for him 
In addition it is also very important to keep in mind that Trump could actually get all of the legitimate votes that he needs to win and still have it stolen from him by election fraud There was widespread evidence of funny business in 2012 and this is something that I detailed for a live studio audience down at Morningsideearlier this month 
Are you starting to see why I would consider this to be the biggest miracle in American political history if Donald Trump actually overcomes all of these factors and wins the election 
And we dont have to wait until November 8th to get some indications about how the vote is going to go Early voting is already taking place is some states and so far the signs are not encouraging for the Trump campaign The following comes from CNN 
Democratic early turnout has stayed steady in North Carolina compared to 2012 while Republicans have dropped by about 14500 In Nevada Democrats have a smaller early voting deficit today than they did at this point in 2012 And Democrats are slightly ahead in Arizona in the early vote so far though they are lagging Republicans in the tally of how many Arizonans have requested ballots 
Perhaps most surprisingly Democrats improved their position in conservative and Mormonheavy Utah where recent polls have shown a tight race At this point in 2012 Republicans led Democrats in early voting by more than 22000 voters But so far this year the GOP advantage is only 3509 
But if you do want Trump to win the good news is that we still have more than two weeks before November 8th 
We have seen some extremely bizarre things happen already in this election and a miracle is definitely not out of the question 
In fact I am of the opinion that it is quite likely that some very strange events could take place between now and early November So hold on to your hats because the most interesting portion of the 2016 election may still be ahead of us",1,if donald trump wins the election it will be the biggest miracle in us political history posted on home headlines world news if donald trump wins the election it will be the biggest miracle in us political history are we about to see the largest election day miracle of all time from michael snyder because as i will show in this article that is precisely what it is going to take in order for donald trump to win before i go any further i want to make it exceedingly clear that i am not saying what the outcome will be on november 8th as i recently told a

this belief this mormon president will turn the country around and all sorts of wonderful things will start to happen many mormons thought that mitt romney was going to be this president but now evan mcmullin has become the target of these expectations so how in the world could evan mcmullin become president well their plan is to have evan mcmullin win utah and that could potentially keep both donald trump and hillary clinton from both getting to 270 electoral votes if the election is super close if that happens the election would be thrown into the house of representatives it is being projected that the house will still be controlled by the republicans after this election and so the choice would come down to either trump or mcmullin and those backing mcmullin believe that he would have a realistic shot in that scenario i know all of this sounds very strange but this is actually being discussed around family dinner tables all over utah tonight and in recent days evan mcmullin has been soaring in utah one recent survey shows trump with a one point lead over mcmullin and another recent survey actually show mcmullin leading trump by four points in the state so trump could pull off a miracle and do everything else that he needs to do to get to 270 electoral votes and utah could end up messing up everything for him in addition it is also very important to keep in mind that trump could actually get all of the legitimate votes that he needs to win and still have it stolen from him by election fraud there was widespread evidence of funny business in 2012 and this is something that i detailed for a live studio audience down at morningsideearlier this month are you starting to see why i would consider this to be the biggest miracle in american political history if donald trump actually overcomes all of these factors and wins the election and we dont have to wait until november 8th to get some indications about how the vote is going to go early voting is already taking place is some states and so far the signs are not encouraging for the trump campaign the following comes from cnn democratic early turnout has stayed steady in north carolina compared to 2012 while republicans have dropped by about 14500 in nevada democrats have a smaller early voting deficit today than they did at this point in 2012 and democrats are slightly ahead in arizona in the early vote so far though they are lagging republicans in the tally of how many arizonans have requested ballots perhaps most surprisingly democrats improved their position in conservative and mormonheavy utah where recent polls have shown a tight race at this point in 2012 republicans led democrats in early voting by more than 22000 voters but so far this year the gop advantage is only 3509 but if you do want trump to win the good news is that we still have more than two weeks before november 8th we have seen some extremely bizarre things happen already in this election and a miracle is definitely not out of the question in fact i am of the opinion that it is quite likely that some very strange events could take place between now and early november so hold on to your hats because the most interesting portion of the 2016 election may still be ahead of us ,if donald trump wins the election it will be the biggest miracle in us political history ,the doc ,donald trump wins election biggest

that Christmas cookie TRY this place a forkful of food in your mouth It doesnt matter what the food is but make it something you love     lets say its that first nibble from three hot fragrant perfectly cooked ravioli Now comes the hard part Put the fork down This could be a lot more challenging than you imagine because that first bite was very good and another immediately beckons Youre hungry Todays experiment in eating however involves becoming aware of that reflexive urge to plow through your meal like Cookie Monster on a shortbread bender Resist it Leave the fork on the table Chew slowly Stop talking Tune in to the texture of the pasta the flavor of the cheese the bright color of the sauce in the bowl the aroma of the rising steam Continue this way throughout the course of a meal and youll experience the    pleasures and frustrations of a practice known as mindful eating The concept has roots in Buddhist teachings Just as there are forms of meditation that involve sitting breathing standing and walking many Buddhist teachers encourage their students to meditate with food expanding consciousness by paying close attention to the sensation and purpose of each morsel In one common exercise a student is given three raisins or a tangerine to spend 10 or 20 minutes gazing at musing on holding and patiently masticating Lately though such experiments of the mouth and mind have begun to seep into a secular arena from the Harvard School of Public Health to the California campus of Google In the eyes of some experts what seems like the simplest of acts

is not a diet or about giving up anything at all Its about experiencing food more intensely     especially the pleasure of it You can eat a cheeseburger mindfully if you wish You might enjoy it a lot

60,60,The Major Potential Impact of a Corporate Tax Overhaul  The New York Times,Neil Irwin,The United States system for taxing businesses is a mess If theres one thing nearly everyone can agree upon it is that The current corporate income tax manages the weird trick of both taxing companies at a higher statutory rate than other advanced countries while collecting less money as a percentage of the overall economy than most of them It is infinitely complicated and it gives companies incentives to borrow too much money and move operations to countries with lower tax rates Now the moment for trying to fix all of that appears to have arrived With the House Senate and presidency all soon to be in Republican hands and with all agreeing that a major tax bill is a top priority some kind of change appears likely to happen And it may turn out to be a very big deal particularly if a tax plan that House Republicans proposed last summer becomes the core of new legislation Among Washingtons lobbying shops and policy analysis crowd its known as a   cash flow tax with border adjustment  Its easier to think of it as the most substantial reworking of how businesses are taxed since the corporate income tax was introduced a century ago And it could if enacted have big effects not just in the tax departments of major corporations but in global financial markets and the aisles of your local Walmart This possible revamping of the corporate tax code is less politically polarizing than the debates sure to unfold in the months ahead over health care or even over individual income taxes But the consequences for business     and for the   trajectory of the economy     are huge The basic idea behind a D B C F T to use the abbreviation that has taken hold in a particularly nerdy corner of Twitter is this Right now companies are taxed based on their income generated in the United States But there are countless tricks that corporate accountants can play to reduce the income companies report and to reduce their tax burden and those tricks distort the economy Two prime examples are transferring intellectual property to overseas holding companies and engaging in corporate inversions that move a companys legal headquarters to a country with lower taxes Moreover because interest payments on debt are   the current system makes it appealing to take on as much debt as possible even though that can increase the risk of bankruptcy when a downturn comes along The House Republicans approach instead of taxing the    corporate income goes after a firms domestic cash flow money that comes in from sales within the United States borders minus money that goes out to pay employees and buy supplies and so forth Theres no incentive to play games with overseas companies that exist only to exploit tax differences or to relocate production to countries with lower taxes because youll be taxed on things you sell in the United States regardless With an income tax one of the key issues is how do you measure income  said Alan Auerbach an economist at the University of California Berkeley who is a leading advocate of the idea But with cash flow you just follow the money  And the tax Mr Auerbach argues could spur business investment while not encouraging companies to rely on debt It allows companies to enjoy the tax savings of capital investments immediately rather than depreciating them over time And it doesnt give favorable treatment to debt as opposed to equity That alone would amount to a major shift in the tax system Congressional staff members the incoming administration and armies of lobbyists will spend countless hours hammering out the details of any such proposal how it might be phased in and how to treat financial services and much more Some of the most complex and politically problematic elements of the plan revolve around its treatment of international trade which creates winners and losers And some of those potential losers are powerful Consider what border adjustment means When an American company exports goods under this new tax system it would not pay any taxes on its international sales while its imports would be taxed So a company that spent 80 making something that it sold overseas for 100 would pay no tax on its earnings A company that imported goods worth 80 from abroad and them sold them domestically for 100 would pay tax on the full 100 At first glance this looks as if it would boost exports and reduce the trade deficit Indeed it might prove politically promising for advocates of the strategy to pitch the plan as one that would do this Many economists think it wont work that way however Thats because as soon as a    tax with border adjustment looks likely to become law the value of the dollar should rise in currency markets And that stronger dollar could eliminate the apparent     effects of the tax The dollar could rise by say 20 to 25 percent and the trade balance could remain about where it started Essentially moving to this system means betting on a textbook economic theory as analysts at Evercore ISI put it becoming a reality even though the effect hasnt been tested in practice If the dollar doesnt strengthen as expected for example   industries especially those with lean profit margins could face disaster That helps explain why some of the stiffest opposition to this tax overhaul is coming from the retail industry Essentially economists are telling them trust us our models say the currency will adjust and it will all come out in the wash but if the models are wrong for companies like Walmart Target and many others that sell large volumes of imported goods their viability could be threatened If the models turn out to be right there is a different set of risks The United States dollar is the linchpin of the global financial system and a large move in its value triggered by changes in domestic tax policy could have unforeseen effects Many companies worldwide especially banks and especially in emerging markets have debt denominated in dollars which would become more of a burden after a new dollar appreciation A big dollar rise would also effectively shift trillions in wealth from American investments overseas toward global investors with assets in the United States As Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has noted we dont really know what the distributional consequences of this tax overhaul would be It could increase the costs of imported goods that the poor spend a disproportionate portion of their income on like clothing and gasoline That would be bad news for poorer Americans even as it makes the overall economy more efficient Theres still a lot of work to be done to understand the   consequences of the D B C F T also work to be done to find a catchier name But theres a broader point about the nature of any major policy reform The benefits of a reworked corporate tax code would emerge slowly these disruptions and costs could arrive almost instantly No matter the outcome 2017 will be a fascinating year in which core components of the tax system     with   economic consequences     will be up for grabs,0,the united states system for taxing businesses is a mess if theres one thing nearly everyone can agree upon it is that the current corporate income tax manages the weird trick of both taxing companies at a higher statutory rate than other advanced countries while collecting less money as a percentage of the overall economy than most of them it is infinitely complicated and it gives companies incentives to borrow too much money and move operations to countries with lower tax rates now the moment for trying to fix all of that appears to have arrived with the house senate and presidency all soon to be in republican hands and with all agreeing that a major tax bill is a top priority some kind of change appears likely to happen and it may turn out to be a very big deal particularly if a tax plan that house republicans proposed last summer becomes the core of new legislation among washingtons lobbying shops and policy analysis crowd its known as a cash flow tax with border adjustment its easier to think of it as the most substantial reworking of how businesses are taxed since the corporate income tax was introduced a century ago and it could if enacted have big effects not just in the tax departments of major corporations but in global financial markets and the aisles of your local walmart this possible revamping of the corporate tax code is less politically polarizing than the debates sure to unfold in the months ahead over health care or even over individual income taxes but the consequences for business and for the trajectory of the economy are huge the basic idea behind a d b c f t to use the abbreviation that has taken hold in a particularly nerdy corner of twitter is this right now companies are taxed based on their income generated in the united states but there are countless tricks that corporate accountants can play to reduce the income companies report and to reduce their tax burden and those tricks distort the economy two prime examples are transferring intellectual property to overseas holding companies and engaging in corporate inversions that move a companys legal headquarters to a country with lower taxes moreover because interest payments on debt are the current system makes it appealing to take on as much debt as possible even though that can increase the risk of bankruptcy when a downturn comes along the house republicans approach instead of taxing the corporate income goes after a firms domestic cash flow money that comes in from sales within the united states borders minus money that goes out to pay employees and buy supplies and so forth theres no incentive to play games with overseas companies that exist only to exploit tax differences or to relocate production to countries with lower taxes because youll be taxed on things you sell in the united states regardless with an income tax one of the key issues is how do you measure income said alan auerbach an economist at the university of california berkeley who is a leading advocate of the idea but with cash flow you just follow the money and the tax mr auerbach argues could spur business investment while not encouraging companies to rely on debt it allows companies to enjoy the tax savings of capital investments immediately rather than depreciating them over time and it doesnt give favorable treatment to debt as opposed to equity that alone would amount to a major shift in the tax system congressional staff members the incoming administration and armies of lobbyists will spend countless hours hammering out the details of any such proposal how it might be phased in and how to treat financial services and much more some of the most complex and politically problematic elements of the plan revolve around its treatment of international trade which creates winners and losers

62,62,3 Makers of Worlds Smallest Machines Awarded Nobel Prize in Chemistry  The New York Times,Kenneth Chang and Sewell Chan,Three pioneers in the development of nanomachines made of moving molecules were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday Molecular machines the worlds smallest mechanical devices may eventually be used to create new materials sensors and energy storage systems the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in announcing the prize In terms of development the molecular motor is at the same stage as the electric motor was in the 1830s when scientists displayed various spinning cranks and wheels unaware that they would lead to electric trains washing machines fans and food processors the academy said The three scientists       Sauvage J Fraser Stoddart and Bernard L Feringa     will share equally in the prize of 8 million Swedish kronor or about 930 000 Nanotechnology     the creation of structures on the scale of a nanometer or a billionth of a meter     has been a field of fruitful research for a couple of decades Now scientists are learning how to construct tiny moving machines about   the width of a strand of human hair Theyve got it started said Donna J Nelson a professor of chemistry at the University of Oklahoma and president of the American Chemical Society This is just the beginning  The first step toward creating a molecular machine was making a moving part Chemists have long been able to synthesize   molecules and they knew that interlocking rings might function as molecular parts But how to create a second ring that passed through the first ring Dr Sauvage figured that out in 1983 A charged copper ion essentially acted as a pin around which to form the interlocking rings he found Once the rings were connected the copper ion could be removed These molecules became known as catenanes The pieces of the molecule were held together mechanically like links in a chain rather than the usual chemical bonds Dr Stoddart made the next advance in 1991 Instead of two interlocking rings Dr Stoddart then at the University of Birmingham in Britain and his colleagues synthesized a rotaxane a ring molecule wrapped around a   axle The ring slides back and forth along the dumbbell like a bead on an abacus Dr Stoddart went on to construct a small computer chip that was essentially a molecular abacus as well as other complex devices One was composed of three rotaxanes whose rings were connected to form a larger platform that could rise 0 7 billionths of a meter a molecular elevator Rotaxanes bending thin layers of gold acted like an artificial muscle he found As a sidelight Dr Sauvage and Dr Stoddart used their techniques to create molecules that twisted in complicated knots Dr Stoddart said in an interview that he was inspired by the interlocking forms in Celtic art Dr Feringa in 1999 became the first person to develop a molecular motor creating a minuscule rotor blade powered by light that spun continually in the same direction The first motor was not fast but 15 years later he and his research group demonstrated one that spun 12 million times per second In 2011 they built a    molecular car  Four of the molecular motors acted as wheels connected by a   The three men invigorated the field of topological chemistry the academy said on Wednesday They were pioneers in the second wave of nanotechnology a field that the physicist Richard P Feynman also a Nobel laureate foresaw as early as 1959 He gave a seminal lecture in 1984 toward the end of his life on design and engineering at the molecular scale In living organisms nature has produced a slew of molecular machines that ferry materials around cells construct proteins and divide cells Artificial molecular machines are still primitive by comparison but scientists can already envision applications in the future Think about nanomachines microrobots said Dr Feringa who spoke by telephone with journalists assembled in Stockholm at the prize announcement Think about tiny robots that the doctor in the future will inject in your blood veins and they go search for cancer cells or going to deliver drugs for instance  The technology could also lead to the creation of smart materials that change properties based on external signals Dr Feringa said Dr Sauvage 71 was born in Paris and received his Ph D in 1971 from the University of Strasbourg in France where he is a professor emeritus He is also director of research emeritus at the National Center for Scientific Research in France Dr Stoddart 74 was born in Edinburgh received his Ph D in 1966 from Edinburgh University and is a professor of chemistry at Northwestern University in Evanston Ill He previously taught at U C L A and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his services to science Dr Feringa 64 was born in   the Netherlands and received his Ph D in 1978 from the University of Groningen where he is a professor of organic chemistry Dr Feringa said he was a bit shocked when he got the phone call telling him he had received the Nobel I feel a little bit like the Wright brothers who were flying 100 years ago for the first time he said People were saying Why do we need a flying machine And now we have a Boeing 747 and an Airbus  The molecular discovery opens up a whole new world of nanomachines he said while acknowledging that as scientists figure out how to make machines that can operate autonomously we have to think about how we can handle these things safely  Dr Stoddarts name had been mentioned for the Nobel for years It really got to the point where I didnt take it very seriously he said He was asleep when the phone rang at 4 a m I detected a Swedish accent and I thought it was probably not a prank Dr Stoddart said When told that he was sharing the prize with Dr Sauvage and Dr Feringa I was totally delighted because these are my scientific brothers in many ways he said James M Tour a professor of chemistry at Rice University in Houston said the Nobel would bestow legitimacy on the field and help convince people that nanomachines are not just fantastical science fiction of the far future No one is making money on these right now but it will come he said These men have established and built up the field in a remarkable way  Dr Tour predicted that the first profitable use of the technology might be machines that open up cell membranes in the body to deliver drugs Its really going to be quite extraordinary he said  Yoshinori Ohsumi a Japanese cell biologist was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for his discoveries on how cells recycle their content a process known as autophagy a Greek term for     David J Thouless F Duncan M Haldane and J Michael Kosterlitz shared the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for their

64,64,Review Lion Brings Tears for a Lost Boy Wiped Dry by Google  The New York Times,A O Scott,The first part of Lion Garth Daviss unabashedly   movie about a remarkable   incident has some of the scary wondrous feeling of a fairy tale The audience is invited to imagine a   time     1986 to be precise     before social media or smartphones or Google In those days a person could get lost which is just what happens to a little boy named Saroo Sunny Pawar who accidentally travels more than 1 000 miles from his home in central India to the streets of Calcutta Saroos mother Priyanka Bose is a laborer in a poor village He and his beloved older brother Guddu Abhishek Bharate supplement her meager wages with whatever casual work they can find In the first scene they are scavenging lumps of coal to exchange for milk at the market Later Saroo follows Guddu to a railroad station where the younger boy accidentally boards an    train that takes him to a city full of strangers who speak a different language With minimal dialogue and graceful editing Mr Davis and the screenwriter Luke Davies convey the Dickensian dimensions of Saroos situation He is small and vulnerable but also smart and resourceful and even as he is exposed to horrifying cruelty he is also a hero on an adventure The enormous pain of his loss is sometimes mitigated by the excitement of discovery You fear for him

65,65,US General Islamic State Chemical Attack Had No Impact on US Forces,Kristina Wong,WASHINGTON     U S and Australian troops advising Iraqi forces got caught up in a chemical weapons attack by the Islamic State ISIS in western Mosul during the weekend a U S general confirmed Wednesday The chemical agent did not affect U S forces and is still undergoing testing said Maj Gen Joseph Martin the commander of U S and coalition ground forces in Iraq  Daesh has used chemicals in the vicinity of Mosul The chemicals have had no impact on the Iraqi Security Forces They had no impact on our forces Martin said using a derogatory Arabic acronym for ISIS A U S defense official said U S forces donned protective gear Australian troops were not exposed to the substance according to an article by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ABC Australian medics provided some Iraqi forces first aid after the attack A U S defense official said those Iraqi forces have returned to duty It is not the first time ISIS has used chemical weapons in Iraq The U S  military coalition confirmed in 2015 the first instances of the terrorist group using sulfur mustard and mustard gas An assessment by IHS Conflict Monitor found in November 2015 that ISIS has used chemicals including chlorine and sulfur mustard agents at least 52 times in Iraq and Syria since 2014 Martin said the chemicals ISIS has used in the past are all   because of the groups lack of production capability He said the chemicals were believed to have been delivered by indirect fire meaning via rocket or some projectile containing the chemical agent Martin said U S forces have the appropriate equipment and training to protect themselves from chemical weapons The attack also raised the question of how closely U S forces are operating with Iraqi forces Officials have said U S troops are not on the front lines fighting ISIS However Martin indicated they are close together and share the same risks Martin said U S forces are with Iraqi security forces at various command and control locations throughout Iraq  Being forward with those command and control facilities they share the same risks the Iraqis do he said He added that U S forces are forward with the Iraqis each and every day  A defense official of unknown nationality told ABC that Australian and U S advisers were with Iraqi forces at the time of the attack Martin characterized ISIS as getting increasingly desperate as Iraqi forces     backed by the U S  military coalition     are succeeding in pushing the terrorist group out of their main stronghold in Iraq Martin said ISIS members were turning on civilians killing hundreds each week As I see it the longer this fight goes on in west Mosul the civilians will suffer at the hands of a brutal enemy This is why ISIS must be defeated quickly he said He said ISIS was using civilians as human shields and fighting from protected sites ISIS uses the tactic of taking civilians hostage for protection while theyre fighting from protected sites ISIS has been indiscriminate in their use of   improvised explosive devices and building IEDs to kill maim and injure innocent civilians as part of their ongoing campaign of terror he said Martin said ISISs leadership has fled and their days are numbered  Meanwhile he said Iraqi forces were getting better They continue to improve their capability and demonstrate a level of professionalism that makes me proud to serve with them Its only a matter of time before they liberate the rest of Mosul and defeat ISIS in Iraq he said,0,washington u s and

66,66,Jury finds all Oregon standoff defendants not guilty of federal conspiracy gun charges,Admin,"Oregon Live  by Maxine Bernstein 
A federal jury on Thursday found Ammon Bundy his brother Ryan Bundy and five codefendants not guilty of conspiring to prevent federal employees from doing their jobs through intimidation threat or force during the 41day occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge 
The Bundy brothers and occupiers Jeff Banta and David Fry also were found not guilty of having guns in a federal facility Kenneth Medenbach was found not guilty of stealing government property and a hung jury was declared on Ryan Bundys charge of theft of FBI surveillance cameras 
More than we could have hoped for said one of Ammon Bundys lawyers J Morgan Philpot 
Stunning said defense lawyer Lisa Ludwig who was standby counsel for Ryan Bundy 
Im just thrilled said Neil Wamplers attorney Lisa Maxfield 
The jury of nine women and three men returned the verdicts after five hours of deliberations on Thursday in the highprofile case that riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the federal bird sanctuary in rural eastern Oregon 
Each defendant stood separately facing the jury as the judge read the verdicts Ammon Bundy his hands clasped behind his back nodded as the not guilty verdicts were read for him first As he sat he smiled and rubbed the shoulder of his lawyer Marcus Mumford 
His older brother Ryan Bundy stood As his not guilty verdicts were read he nodded and mouthed to the jury Thank you Defendant Neil Wampler hugged and kissed his defense lawyer Maxfield 
The coda to the stunning verdict undoubtedly a significant blow to federal prosecutors was when Ammon Bundys lawyer Marcus Mumford argued that his client dressed in a gray suit and white dress shirt should be allowed to walk out of the court a free man 
US District Judge Anna J Brown told him that there was a US Marshals hold on him from a pending federal indictment in Nevada 
Oregon Standoff defendant Jeff Banta is relieved by acquittals 
If theres a detainer show me Mumford stood arguing before the judge 
Suddenly a group of about six US Marshals surrounded Mumford at his defense table The judge directed them to move back but moments later the marshals grabbed on to him 
What are you doing Mumford yelled as he struggled and was taken down to the floor 
As deputy marshals yelled Stop resisting the judge demanded Everybody out of the courtroom now 
Mumford was taken into custody a member of his legal team confirmed 
Ammon Bundys lawyer J Morgan Philpot said afterwards on the courthouse steps that Mumford had been arrested and marshals had used a stun gun or Taser on his back Another member of Ammon Bundys legal team Rick Koerber echoed Philpot saying he heard Mumford questioning in court why they were using a Taser against him 
Philpot decried the marshals treatment of Mumford in the courtroom What happened at the end is symbolic of the improper use of force by the federal government he said 
By 630 pm Mumford was released from custody He confirmed that he was struck with a stun gun once while he was on the floor of the courtroom 
I grew up on a dairy farm so am I used to some rough treatment sure he said But he said the actions of the US marshals were uncalled for 
All I was asking for was papers Just show me you have the authority to take Mr Bundy into custody 
As to the verdict Very pleased very gratified This jury was dedicated They listened to our case 
Just after the verdicts were announced people emerged onto the front steps of the courthouse to tell a crowd of media and onlookers 
Supporters of the defendants gathered in a joyous hug One of them Brand Thornton of Las Vegas one of the original occupiers who accompanied Ryan Bundy and others onto the refuge on Jan 2 and was called as witness by the defense said that he has been at the trial since Oct 2 
The verdict means everything Thornton said Its huge for ranchers and land rights within Harney County and across the West he said 
We did something peaceful and wanted to stay peaceful said Thornton who has kept vigil outside the courthouse blowing a shofar 
This is for the people of Oregon Thornton said This was never for us 
Wampler appeared on the courthouse steps and described the verdict as a stunning victory for rural America 
David Frys lawyer Per C Olson said It was the right result 
I think the jury saw through this that they were wellmeaning wellintentioned individuals Olson said The jury saw that the defendants cared about the Hammonds and didnt like how the federal government was treating them 
Maxfield who represented Wampler came out of the courthouse holding up her fists She said she has never seen anything like this happen where multiple defendants in a federal court trial were all acquitted and called it one of the most significant cases in her career 
Defendant Shawna Cox said she had a peaceful feeling as she waited for the verdicts but I didnt expect wed all be found not guilty 
I wept Cox said It brings me to tears Im so grateful to the jury 
Defense lawyer Matthew Schindler standby counsel to defendant Kenneth Medenbach who was excused from court because of medical ailments said he called his client right away 
Hes been fighting for more than 20 years to be in a situation where a jury acquitted him Schindler said Its vindication 
Schindler said he believes the jurys verdicts resulted from the difficulty the government had in proving that the intent of the defendants was to conspire against the US Fish and Wildlife Service and US Bureau of Land Management 
The judge gave us broad ability to bring in a defendants state of mind and what you saw was a number of defendants who each had their own motivations Schindler said 
When prosecuting a drug conspiracy its easy to point to what the defendants underlying objective is But in this case Schindler said there was no obvious underlying self interest He said the defense also was bolstered because the jurors came from different regions from the state and not just from Portland 
Oregon US Attorney Billy Williams sat in the back of the courtroom with Oregons FBI Special Agent in Charge Gregg Bretzing as the verdicts were read Williams left the courtroom early before the scrum with Mumford to attend a gathering of the League of Minority Voters in Salem Thursday night 
Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward who was the face of law enforcement during the 41day refuge takeover said in a statement While I am disappointed in the outcome I believe our form of government and justice system to be the best in the world These folks were tried in a court of law and found not guilty by a jury of their peers This is our system and I stand by it 
The fiveweek trial offered a rare display Three of the seven defendants chose to represent themselves Five of them were among the more than 80 people who took the witness stand to testify 
And one of the original 12 jurors was dismissed after a fellow juror raised concerns about his impartiality four days into an initial round of deliberations  what the judge called an extraordinary circumstance An alternate juror was summoned to begin a new round of deliberations with the remaining 11 jurors Thursday morning 
There was heightened security in and around the courthouse throughout the trial with security officers ordered to wear bulletproof vests and metal detectors set up outside the main trial courtroom and an overflow room with a live video feed of the proceedings 
Often supporters knelt in prayer in the courthouse corridor before the trial began in the mornings and some kept vigil across the street with one fellow occupier blowing a rams horn or shofar as the jury deliberated 
PENDING PROSECUTIONS 
The seven on trial were among 26 people indicted on the conspiracy charge 
Eleven of them pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge 
Seven others are set for trial on Feb 14 but their cases may be affected by the verdicts If convictions are handed down in this case then defendants scheduled for trial in February might consider potential pleas If there are acquittals prosecutors may rethink going to trial on same charges against codefendants next year 
On the eve of jury selection in this case prosecutors agreed to dismiss the conspiracy charge against Pete Santilli an independent broadcaster and selfdescribed shock jock who provided live stream footage of the occupation 
NEVADA CASE 
Ammon Bundy and Ryan Bundy also face prosecution in Nevada in the 2014 standoff with federal agents over the impounding of their fathers cattle near Bunkerville Nevada 
The trial there is set to start Feb 6 The two brothers and father Cliven Bundy are among 19 indicted in Nevada Others from the Oregon refuge occupation also indicted on federal charges in Nevada are Pete Santilli Ryan Payne Brian Cavalier Blaine Cooper and Joseph OShaughnessy 
Payne pleaded guilty to the federal conspiracy charge in Oregon under a potential global agreement that was in the works with Nevada prosecutors but he recently asked to withdraw the Oregon plea because no deal was reached in Nevada Prosecutors in Portland have until Oct 31 to respond 
Cooper entered guilty pleas in both cases OShaughnessy pleaded guilty in the Oregon case with a deal pending in Nevada Cavalier pleaded guilty in the Oregon case

It takes guts and courage to run a presidential campaign based on ideas and principles Donald Trump lacking in both the guts and courage departments which is why he is spending the final days of his presidential campaign trying to con and scheme his way into the Oval Office

70,70,How To Make Briquettes From Daily Waste,Chris Black,"  22 2016 How To Make Briquettes From Daily Waste 
Do you remember that old saying that one mans garbage is another mans treasure The same principle applies to our daily wastes 
In case you did not know it Americans are among the most wasteful civilization in history Actually I would dare to say that we are the champions my friends and thats nothing to be proud of 
We waste at an incredible rate absolutely anything including food where we lead the world by a wide margin Also as a nation the United States generates more municipal solidwaste per personper day than any other developedindustrial country in the world boasting 71 pounds of solid waste a day per person 
If you crunch these numbers 365 days a year x 330 million people x 71 pounds of solid waste  youll come up with astonishing numbers 
Putting Waste to Work for Energy 
It was a Greek philosopher who once said 2000 years ago that nothing gets wasted  everything gets transformed or something along these lines To follow this guys axiom we can transform waste into an excellent and basically perpetual source of energy  
We the preppers can help mitigate the disaster and put that amount of waste to good use by making briquettes using daily wastes 
Briquettes are traditionally defined as compressed blocks of combustible material  usually coal dust wood chips paper peat or sawdust  that are used to start a fire The terms derives from the French language and it means brick 
Biomass briquettes are starting to become all the rage nowadays and daily waste is basically biomass Traditionally biomass briquettes are built from agricultural waste and theyre used as a green replacement for hydrocarbons coal oil etc in all sorts of applications including industrial stuff like heating boilers and whatnot 
Currently almost half of the worlds population is using charcoal andor wood for heating and cooking purposes 
Cutting the forest for subsistence farming or for cooking your food or heating your home is not a great idea if you have better alternatives and thats the whole purpose of technology making the world a better place and improving   humans right 
Any household can reduce their need for charcoal and wood by creating their own fuel so to speak by making fuel briquettes using waste plant material which is readily available in their own environment 
How to Make the Briquettes 
So what type of wastes can be reused for making fuel briquettes Paper Charcoal fines Any other type of agricultural waste 
Its important to realize that not all waste is created equal and this is where the calorific value of each type of waste comes into play 
As a general rule of thumb the aforementioned materials are the best when it comes to DIY fuel briquettes sawdust paper etc but youll have to use a homemade press for achieving legendary status ie becoming energy selfsufficient as much as humanly possible 
There are also commercially available presses Youll just have to look for them on the internet or in   
The fuel briquettes are being made around the world using mini Bryant and Peterson presses You can also make them by hand or using a plastic mold Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World  
You can also use a plastic mold Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World  
Basically you can use a plastic bottle or any other type of plastic container in order to shape the briquette Youll also need something that you can use as a piston that fits into the respective container to press it in order to get the water out of the mix You can use something like a tin can or a piece of wood as the piston along with a plastic bag a knife and some wire 
Heres a cool idea about DIYing a moldpress biomass fuel briquette using an old DVD container The possibilities are basically endless

How to Make Briquettes in Easy Steps 
Step 1  preparing the briquette mix 
For example if youre going to use waste paper and sawdust the simplest to DIY and very efficient and cost effective youll have to soak the paper in water for a couple of days in order to soften it and to allow the fibers to be released as these fibers will later bind the materials together 
In the next step youll have to thoroughly homogenize the soaked paper using your hands until the stuff reaches the consistency of porridge or mashed potatoes ie no pieces are evident in the soup This step is very important but it takes some time and youll have to do it well 
To speed up the process you can use tools such as a mortar and pestle or a dedicated pounding tool for processing the paper mix quickly and more efficiently 
The simplest mix for homemade briquettes consists of one part soaked paper and 34 parts sawdust You can also add pine needles rice husks chopped leavesgrass charcoal fines and any other flammable materials you can think of into the mix as theyll add to the flavor Youll have to use roughly 20 paper though  thats the lesson to be taken home 
You can alternatively swap paper for cassava peelsflour which can replace the papers binding properties into the sawdustmix Youll have to boil the cassava until it gets very soft but in sufficient amounts the cassava paste will successfully replace the paper for the purpose of binding the sawdust together 
In the next step youll have to mix the paper or cassava mixture with the sawdust along with enough water The mix must hold together if squeezed thats how you determine the ideal consistency 
Step 2  prepare the press 
This step depends on whether youre using a cool home press or an improvised device Lets say youre on the lowtech side and youre using a plastic bottle mold as an improvised briquettemaking device 
Youll have to cut the upper quarter of the plastic bottle a soda bottle will do and perforate the bottom making 1012 drainage holes You can use a hot wire to burn the holes 
Then youll require a thin plastic bag to be used as a liner to help you remove the finished briquette from bottle Dont forget to punch drainage holes in the plastic bag too both on the sides and in the bottom so the water can be expelled during the pressing process 
Obviously you can use something bigger than a plastic bottle like a plastic bucket or a plastic flower pot Ideally youll have two of each one for playing the role of the mold and the second to act as a piston Dont forget to put drainage holes in the plastic liner though  otherwise the water wont drain and youre wasting your time 
Step 3  press the mix 
In this step youll have to put a quantity of briquettemix inside the plastic liner bag and then insert the bag into the mold Then youll have to add more mix to the bag and press it with the improvised piston a can the other bucketanother bottle or whatever fits into the mold so the water gets pushed out of the mix 
Push as hard as you can  the harder the better Then youll have to pull the bag out of the mold and heres your first briquette folks 
Step 4  dry your briquettes 
But its not over yet Youll have to dry your briquettes for about a week outside in the sun If theyre not properly dried the briquettes will smoke when burned and thats unpleasant to say the least 
If you cant improvise a mold andor a press you can always make fuelbriquettes with just your hands squeezing the mix in your bare hands and building fuel balls and youll have to dry these out too obviously 
There are so many survival things you can do by yourself   discover   wood creations

73,73,At 91 Ella Brennan Still Feeds and Leads New Orleans  The New York Times,Brett Anderson,NEW ORLEANS     A typical evening for Ella Brennan begins with cocktails They are delivered from Commanders Palace her familys restaurant next door to her mansion in this citys historic Garden District Drinks are often followed by dinner also from Commanders and wine Ms Brennan favors Champagne and distinguished whites from the Côte de Beaune because as she puts it Im too damn old to drink cheap wine and because I can  In New Orleans there is little question that Miss Ella as Ms Brennan is widely known here has earned her sense of entitlement Her hometowns civic pride is tightly linked to its reputation for culinary excellence Ms Brennan helped create that reputation and has made maintaining it a personal responsibility for more than 60 years At 91 she is the matriarch of an extended family of restaurateurs that employs nearly 1 400 people both full and part time and she has mentored countless talents including the celebrity chefs Paul Prudhomme and Emeril Lagasse She was there to embrace and elevate not just me but the entire staff said Mr Lagasse whom Ms Brennan plucked from obscurity and installed at age 23 as Commanders chef in the early 1980s The list of people she has impacted in the hospitality industry in America is endless  Ms Brennans family has recently set out to ensure that her legacy is appreciated beyond New Orleans Those efforts culminated last year with the release of a memoir Miss Ella of Commanders Palace written with Ti Martin her daughter It was followed by the documentary Ella Brennan Commanding the Table directed by Leslie Iwerks The film which has been screening at festivals will be available on Netflix in May The book and film tell the story of a     businesswoman     her other nickname is Hurricane Ella     who excelled in a   profession decades before gender imbalance in the restaurant industry became a hot issue When I first started you would hardly ever see another woman in the kitchen much less running the show said Sue Zemanick the former chef at Gautreaus a Top Chef Masters contestant and a line cook at Commanders early in her career Working at a restaurant with such strong women in charge gave me hope that I could make it  While Ms Brennan is as Ms Martin put it as retired as Mom is capable of being her New Orleans restaurants which include Café Adelaide and SoBou remain an obsession for her they are managed by Ms Martin and Lally Brennan a niece of Ms Brennan On a recent afternoon Ms Brennan sat next to the unlit fireplace in her living room As she moved a sore leg back and forth between an ottoman and the floor she suggested that her impulse to empower employees was a rejection of restaurant industry norms she confronted as a young woman In those days no one was paying attention to developing people she said A restaurateur has to be part of a team to make something everyone can be proud of  Her decision to tap Mr Prudhomme a Cajun to run Commanders kitchen in the 1970s loosened the grip that   chefs had on American fine dining Alongside Ms Brennan and later on his own the   Mr Prudhomme helped set the table for a renaissance in American regional cooking that has yet to abate New Orleans was really the centerpiece of the whole American food movement the New York restaurateur Drew Nieporent said And Ella put New Orleans on the map  Ms Brennan entered the hospitality business as a teenager working at the Old Absinthe House a Bourbon Street bar owned by her brother Owen 15 years her senior She had dropped out of a local business school after deciding as she wrote in her book that I wasnt going to type for any man  In 1946 Mr Brennan bought Vieux Carré a French Quarter restaurant that Ms Brennan described recently with typical candor as terrible  Mr Brennan hired her to manage the business looking to prove that an Irish family could operate a restaurant superior to established   restaurants like Arnauds Antoines and Galatoires I didnt know anything Ms Brennan recalled But Owen was a raconteur He slept till noon He got me to do all of the things he didnt like So I learned  A voracious reader she pored over books recommended by the restaurants two chefs Jack Eames and Paul Blangé whose respect she sought and whom she frequently praised I was amazed at their talent she said They were like surgeons  The gregarious Brennan family     the other siblings were Dick Adelaide Dottie and John     cultivated a clientele of influential locals and visitors including celebrities All the while Ms Brennan worked with the chefs to elevate Vieux Carrés food For inspiration she traveled frequently to New York City where she became a regular at the 21 Club Culinary pioneers like James Beard and Helen McCully the food editor of McCalls magazine took the young visitor under their wings You had to go to New York in those days Ms Brennan said I was trying to get New Orleans to that level  In 1955 the Brennans were preparing to relocate Vieux Carré to a larger space on Royal Street when Owen died of a heart attack at 45 It fell to Ms Brennan to carry out her brothers vision for the new restaurant which would be called Brennans By all accounts Brennans ushered in a new age for fine dining in the South It became a grand showcase for New Orleans joie de vivre replete with a wine cellar antiques and food that stretched the boundaries of traditional   cuisine The national press took notice especially of its boozy multicourse breakfasts America was coming to appreciate dining as entertainment Ms Brennan wrote and all of the newspapers were just beginning to have columns about food  Ms Brennan helped develop new dishes including bananas Foster She pushed to expand the familys restaurant properties with spotty success aggravating a rift between Owens heirs and what came to be known as Ellas side of the family In 1973 Ms Brennan was dismissed from Brennans initiating a bitter litigious family split that has never fully healed It was a tragedy Ms Brennan said Family is everything to us  Owen Brennans sons continued to run Brennans until 2013 when a group that includes Ralph Brennan a son of John Brennan purchased the   property at a sheriffs auction Brennans of Houston overseen by Ms Brennans son Alex is part of her restaurant group Commanders Palace which Ms Brennan acquired in 1969 was a sprawling property in need of repair In partnership with her sisters and brothers she set about turning it into a restaurant that would eclipse Brennans Early reviews werent favorable But over time Commanders became renowned for its sophisticated blending of south Louisiana and nouvelle cuisines     Ms Brennan christened the style haute Creole     and its warm celebratory approach to fine dining We want people who eat here to feel important and we want them to have fun Ms Brennan said Ms Brennan never presumed that her management responsibilities ended at the kitchen door Alex McCrery a Commanders line cook in the early 2000s recalled that Ms Brennan admonished another cook for proposing that the kitchen make mustard ice cream She was the type who was like your mom is when she is disappointed in you Mr McCrery said She was stern and youd feel like you really messed up  Ms Brennan said she gave up men for Lent after her divorce in 1970 from Paul Martin She also never learned to cook I dont think she can boil water Mr Lagasse said but that doesnt prevent her from giving lavish dinner parties in the home she shares with Dottie We dont carry on like we once did she said before a recent meal But I do like to take advantage of living next door to my restaurant  A waiter carried Ms Brennans drink as she moved with the aid of a walker from her   parlor to her   dining room She sat at the head of the table as Commanders waiters delivered a series of courses from the restaurants kitchen As she sank her spoon into a steaming sea urchin and stone crab soufflé Ms Brennan explained that entertaining gives her an opportunity to weigh in on new ideas from Tory McPhail Commanders current and   chef It also allows her to partake in the kind of pleasure she has provided others for so long What were doing here tonight is letting him experiment on us she said referring to Mr McPhail who had just introduced a course of lamb osso buco Ms Brennan was as engaged and vivacious as when the evening began As Mr McPhail turned to leave she called after him Bring back a bottle of Champagne will you Recipe Bananas Foster,0,new orleans a typical evening for ella brennan begins with cocktails they are delivered from commanders palace her familys restaurant next door to her mansion in this citys historic garden district drinks are often followed by dinner also from commanders and wine ms brennan favors champagne and distinguished whites from the de beaune because as she puts it im too damn old to drink cheap wine and because i can in new orleans there is little question that miss ella as ms brennan is widely known here has earned her sense of entitlement her hometowns civic pride is tightly linked to its reputation for culinary excellence ms brennan helped create that reputation and has made maintaining it a personal responsibility for more than 60 years at 91 she is the matriarch of an extended family of restaurateurs that employs nearly 1 400 people both full and part time and she has mentored countless talents including the celebrity chefs paul prudhomme and emeril lagasse she was there to embrace and elevate not just me but the entire staff said mr lagasse whom ms brennan plucked from obscurity and installed at age 23 as commanders chef in the early 1980s the list of people she has impacted in the hospitality industry in america is endless ms brennans family has recently set out to ensure that her legacy is appreciated beyond new orleans those efforts culminated last year with the release of a memoir miss ella of commanders palace written with ti martin her daughter it was followed by the documentary ella brennan commanding the table directed by leslie iwerks the film which has been screening at festivals will be available on netflix in may the book and film tell the story of a businesswoman her other nickname is hurricane ella who excelled in a profession decades before gender imbalance in the restaurant industry became a hot issue when i first started you would hardly ever see another woman in the kitchen much less running the show said sue zemanick the former chef at gautreaus a top chef masters contestant and a line cook at commanders early in her career working at a restaurant with such strong women in charge gave me hope that i could make it while ms brennan is as ms martin put it as retired as mom is capable of being her new orleans restaurants which include adelaide and sobou remain an obsession for her they are managed by ms martin and lally brennan a niece of ms brennan on a recent afternoon ms brennan sat next to the unlit fireplace in her living room as she moved a sore leg back and forth between an ottoman and the floor she suggested that her impulse to empower employees was a rejection of restaurant industry norms she confronted as a young woman in those days no one was paying attention to developing people she said a restaurateur has to be part of a team to make something everyone can be proud of her decision to tap mr prudhomme a cajun to run commanders kitchen in the 1970s loosened the grip that chefs had on american fine dining alongside ms brennan and later on his own the mr prudhomme helped set the table for a renaissance in american regional cooking that has yet to abate new orleans was really the centerpiece of the whole american food movement the new york restaurateur drew nieporent said and ella put new orleans on the map ms brennan entered the hospitality business as a teenager working at the old absinthe house a bourbon street bar owned by her brother owen 15 years her senior she had dropped out of a local business school after deciding as she wrote in her book that i wasnt going to type for any man in 1946 mr brennan bought vieux a french quarter restaurant that ms brennan described recently with typical candor as terrible mr brennan hired her to manage the business looking to prove that an irish family could operate a restaurant superior to established restaurants like arnauds antoines and galatoires i didnt know anything ms brennan recalled but owen was a raconteur he slept till noon he got me to do all of the things he didnt like so i learned a voracious reader she pored over books recommended by the restaurants two chefs jack eames and paul whose respect she sought and whom she frequently praised i was amazed at their talent she said they were like surgeons the gregarious brennan family the other siblings were dick adelaide dottie and john cultivated a clientele of influential locals and visitors including celebrities all the while ms brennan worked with the chefs to elevate vieux food for inspiration she traveled frequently to new york city where she became a regular at the 21 club culinary pioneers like james beard and helen mccully the food editor of mccalls magazine took the young visitor under their wings you had to go to new york in those days ms brennan said i was trying to get new orleans to that level in 1955 the brennans were preparing to relocate vieux to a larger space on royal street when owen died of a heart attack at 45 it fell to ms brennan to carry out her brothers vision for the new restaurant which would be called brennans by all accounts brennans ushered in a new age for fine dining in the south it became a grand showcase for new orleans joie de vivre replete with a wine cellar antiques and food that stretched the boundaries of traditional cuisine the national press took notice especially of its boozy multicourse breakfasts america was coming to appreciate dining as entertainment ms brennan wrote and all of the newspapers were just beginning to have columns about food ms brennan helped develop new dishes including bananas foster she pushed to expand the familys restaurant properties with spotty success aggravating a rift between owens heirs and what came to be known as ellas side of the family in 1973 ms brennan was dismissed

74,74,Pressing Asia Agenda Obama Treads Lightly on Human Rights  The New York Times,Jane Perlez,HANGZHOU China     Human rights barely registered on President Obamas latest visit to China which ended Monday night with a news conference at which he made only a glancing reference to differences with Beijing over religious freedom  And as Mr Obama moved on to Laos for a summit meeting of Asian nations human rights advocates worried that their concerns were falling off the American agenda not only with China but also across the region for the same reason Beijings continuing rise as an economic and geopolitical power As China challenges the United States for influence in Asia the administration is concerned that any criticism of nations like Malaysia Vietnam the Philippines and Laos for backsliding on human rights could alienate them rather than pulling them closer At the same time shining a spotlight on Chinas own rough treatment of dissidents risks losing Beijings cooperation on issues like trade climate change and nuclear proliferation Rights advocates accused the administration of being too timid arguing that the United States should put as much pressure on governments over how they treat their citizens as they do during trade negotiations Decades of experience should make clear to Washington that Beijing responds only to the expectation of unpleasant consequences said Sophie Richardson the China director for Human Rights Watch Why not threaten sanctions cut out the pointless pomp or visibly align with peaceful critics of the government she said On other diplomatic economic and security issues governments recognize and use these points of leverage Why not on human rights Others say Mr Obama who speaks openly about civil rights in the United States has been wise not to inject the issue into talks with China even as Beijing has carried out the most sweeping crackdown on Chinese civil society in nearly 20 years They say the president understands that a more powerful China is better able to resist American pressure on human rights than it was a decade ago To its credit the Obama administration has not exacerbated the many U S  economic and security issues with a   human rights policy said Robert S Ross a professor of political science at Boston College It is quite a stretch to argue that diplomacy could persuade an authoritarian   government to undermine its domestic political power by allowing greater opposition to the government and tolerating greater political instability  The pattern is now extending beyond Chinas borders During Mr Obamas visit to Laos a tiny country run by a repressive Communist regime he so far has chosen not to publicly raise the case of an   civil rights worker who disappeared at a police checkpoint four years ago He has refrained at least in public from criticizing the new president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte who has been unapologetic about waging a violent war against drugs in the first two months of his term On Wednesday a day after Mr Obama abruptly canceled a meeting with Mr Duterte who had unleashed a   diatribe against him the two men met informally During Mr Obamas visit to Vietnam in May he agreed to lift a longstanding ban on the sale of lethal weapons without winning significant concessions on human rights And after trying to draw Malaysia closer Mr Obama has been embarrassed by the countrys prime minister Najib Razak who has closed online news outlets and prosecuted opposition figures in an effort to stay in power The Obama administration has pressed China on human rights in a   way on only a few occasions In 2012 the American Embassy in Beijing harbored Chen Guangcheng a blind Chinese dissident and flew him to the United States But the days when the White House could demand and expect the release of a few Chinese political prisoners before a summit meeting are gone Professor Ross said As the Chinese Communist Party gained confidence it began rearresting dissidents who had been released before American summit meetings Since then Professor Ross said U S human rights diplomacy has been reduced to rhetoric which no surprise has not improved Chinas human rights situation  Despite Mr Obamas fleeting public reference to religious repression this week for example few expect the Chinese authorities to retreat from a campaign against Christian churches in the area surrounding Hangzhou the city that hosted the Group of 20 meeting One of the new challenges for Mr Obama and one for his successor will be how to deal with Mr Duterte The police in the Philippines say they have killed about 1 000 suspects in the antidrug campaign and about 300 people have been killed by vigilantes Rights groups have urged the United States to do something about the situation Itd be difficult for us to overstate how grave the situation has become in the Philippines said John Sifton the deputy Washington director of Human Rights Watch At this rate were talking about over 6 000 people dead by the end of the year  But the Philippines is an American ally and a bulwark against Chinese military gains in the South China Sea By that calculus the United States cannot afford to alienate Mr Duterte Philippine analysts say that Mr Duterte is on good terms with Chinese business executives who invested in Davao the city where he served as mayor and that he may be open to negotiating with Beijing over the South China Sea Under American legislation known as the Leahy Amendment Washington is obliged to cut off assistance to Philippines law enforcement units that are suspected of human rights abuses But Antonio La Viña a professor of government at Ateneo de Manila University said the threat of such a sanction was unlikely to be effective The truth is that the Philippines has the money to modernize our military he said Mr Obama is the first sitting American president to visit Laos and he has sought to promote reconciliation with the nation on which the United States dropped more than two million tons of bombs at the height of the Vietnam War But he is also being called on to press Laoss repressive government     a traditional ally of China     on

She has demonstrated a recognition that this is a problem that must be solved said Tom Malinowski the United States assistant secretary for democracy human rights and labor The Obama administration has been less vocal on conditions in Vietnam which it has tried to steer closer to the United States in the face of Chinese pressure over territorial disputes in the South China Sea Since then the human rights situation has only deteriorated said Nguyen Quang A an activist and a former member of the Vietnamese Communist Party who was invited to meet Mr Obama in Hanoi but who was stopped by

75,75,Democrats Have a 60 Percent Chance to Retake the Senate  The New York Times,Josh Katz,The Upshots new Senate election forecast gives Democrats a 60 percent chance of winning control of the chamber in November Included within this 60 percent is a 17 percent chance that the Senate ends up evenly split with a Democratic vice president providing the tiebreaking vote By our count the Democrats need to win five seats among the 11 most competitive races The Democrats will need to win six if Donald J Trump wins the presidential race we put Mr Trumps chances of winning at only  11 percent Ten of these seats are held by Republicans and one by a Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada who is retiring That the Democrats are favored in this election should not be surprising The 2016 Senate elections boded well for the Democrats without any consideration of a possible Trump effect on   races In recent history Democrats have done better in presidential election years than in midterm years when turnout is lower Most of the senators up for   last went before the voters in the Republican wave election of 2010     when the G O P made big and broad gains in an   environment     leaving Republicans with several potentially vulnerable incumbents This year the Democrats are defending only 10 seats while the Republicans have to preserve 24 On fundamentals alone     that is historical voting patterns the candidates political experience and       the Democrats would have about a   shot to win the Senate The latest Senate polling improves this figure to 60 percent The framework for our model is broadly similar to the approach we took in 2014 when our Election Day forecast correctly called 35 of 36 Senate races That approach means starting with the fundamentals as a prior then updating those beliefs as polling information comes in We let races affect one another and assume that the    errors will be correlated The main difference between 2014 and this year is that we have some additional information to gauge candidates chances in a presidential year Previous research suggests that there is a strong relationship between presidential and Senate voting Accordingly our model assumes that Senate races will track the presidential race in each state to some degree That is if Hillary Clinton has improved her standing in the presidential forecast since the last time a state has been polled we   the Senate polling average a small amount in the same direction Incumbents are running in seven of the 10 seats being defended by Democrats All seven seats are considered safe For the other three  Democrats are guaranteed to win the seat in California Barbara Boxer is retiring and two Democrats     Kamala Harris and Loretta Sanchez     won the top two spots in an open primary  Initial polling in Maryland showed the Democratic candidate Chris Van Hollen up by 20 to 30 points  Its only in Nevada where Catherine Cortez Masto is trying to replace Mr Reid where the election is competitive This leaves Democrats with 36 seats that are not up for election this year     including two independents Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine who both caucus with Democrats     in addition to nine safe seats Much of the weakness in the Republican position comes from seven G O P incumbents in mostly   states trying to win a second term after first being elected in the Republican wave year of 2010 Ron Johnson in Wisconsin Mark Kirk in Illinois Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania Roy Blunt in Missouri Rob Portman in Ohio and Marco Rubio in Florida assuming he wins the Republican primary next week In addition the retirement of the Republican Dan Coats along with the entry of the former Democratic senator Evan Bayh in the race in Indiana shifted that seat from a likely Republican hold to a possible Democratic pickup Richard Burrs seat in North Carolina also seems vulnerable Polling indicates that even Senator John McCain of Arizona could be swept out by the encroaching Democratic tide If Mr McCain beats back a primary challenge from the Tea Party candidate Kelli Ward he will face a Democratic challenger Ann Kirkpatrick who was within two points in a June poll Our model gives Ms Kirkpatrick a roughly    chance of taking the seat To give themselves a cushion in retaking the Senate Democrats would probably need to win six of these 11 races the seven elections with   Republicans the elections in Indiana Arizona and North Carolina and the contest for Mr Reids seat in Nevada If Mrs Clinton wins the presidency and they win five seats they will most likely control that chamber because the vice president has the tiebreaking vote in the Senate With so many seats remaining uncertain the race could still tip in either direction with Republicans possibly retaining a slim majority or Democrats running the table As of today the most likely outcome is a tie,0,the upshots new senate election forecast gives democrats a 60 percent chance of winning control of the chamber in november included within this 60 percent is a 17 percent chance that the senate ends up evenly split with a democratic vice president providing the tiebreaking vote by our count the democrats need to win five seats among the 11 most competitive races the democrats will need to win six if donald j trump wins the presidential race we put mr trumps chances of winning at only 11 percent ten of these seats are held by republicans and one by a democrat harry reid of nevada who is retiring that the democrats are favored in this election should not be surprising the 2016 senate elections boded well for the democrats without any consideration of a possible trump effect on races in recent history democrats have done better in presidential election years than in midterm years when turnout is lower most of the senators up for last went before the voters in the republican wave election of 2010 when the g o p made big and broad gains in an environment leaving republicans with several potentially vulnerable incumbents this year the democrats are defending only 10 seats while the republicans have to preserve 24 on fundamentals alone that is historical voting patterns the candidates political experience and the democrats would have about a shot to win the senate the latest senate polling improves this figure to 60 percent the framework for our model is broadly similar to the approach we took in 2014 when our election day forecast correctly called 35 of 36 senate races that approach means starting with the fundamentals as a prior then updating those beliefs as polling information comes in we let races affect one another and assume that the errors will be correlated the main difference between 2014 and this year is that we have some additional information to gauge candidates chances in a presidential year previous research suggests that there is a strong relationship between presidential and senate voting accordingly our model assumes that senate races will track the presidential race in each state to some degree that is if hillary clinton has improved her standing in the presidential forecast since the last time a state has been polled we the senate polling average a small amount in the same direction incumbents are running in seven of the 10 seats being defended by democrats all seven seats are considered safe for the other three democrats are guaranteed to win the seat in california barbara boxer is retiring and two democrats kamala harris and loretta sanchez won the top two spots

Bob Unruh  WND 
For a third time a federal judge has affirmed a nationwide injunction against the Obama administrations agenda to impose mandatory openrestroom policies on schools from coast to coast scolding the White House for repeating old arguments and catching those who submitted the newest arguments in a lie 
The ruling this week from US District Judge Reed OConnor left intact his nationwide injunction against Obamas decision that transgender public school students can use the restroom of their choice rather than the restroom designated for their physical sex 
The White House issued the order some months ago and when several states sued OConnor found in August that they were likely to prevail in their arguments so he suspended implementation of the program nationwide 
In October when he had to address the issue again because of demands from the White House he doubled down stating It is clear from Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit precedent that this court has the power to issue a nationwide injunction where appropriate Both Title IX and Title VII rely on the consistent uniform application of national standards in education and workplace policy 
A nationwide injunction is necessary because the alleged violation extends nationwide Defendants are a group of agencies and administrators capable of enforcing their guidelines nationwide affecting numerous state and school district facilities across the country

78,78,51 US Diplomats Urge Strikes Against Assad in Syria  The New York Times,Mark Landler,WASHINGTON     More than 50 State Department diplomats have signed an internal memo sharply critical of the Obama administrations policy in Syria urging the United States to carry out military strikes against the government of President Bashar   to stop its persistent violations of a   in the countrys    civil war The memo a draft of which was provided to The New York Times by a State Department official says American policy has been overwhelmed by the unrelenting violence in Syria It calls for a judicious use of   and air weapons which would undergird and drive a more focused and   U S  diplomatic process  Such a step would represent a radical shift in the administrations approach to the civil war in Syria and there is little evidence that President Obama has plans to change course Mr Obama has emphasized the military campaign against the Islamic State over efforts to dislodge Mr Assad Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict led by Secretary of State John Kerry have all but collapsed But the memo filed in the State Departments dissent channel underscores the deep rifts and lingering frustration within the administration over how to deal with a war that has killed more than 400 000 people The State Department set up the channel during the Vietnam War as a way for employees who had disagreements with policies to register their protest with the secretary of state and other top officials without fear of reprisal While dissent cables are not that unusual the number of signatures on this document 51 is extremely large if not unprecedented The names on the memo are almost all midlevel officials     many of them career diplomats     who have been involved in the administrations Syria policy over the last five years at home or abroad They range from a Syria desk officer in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs to a former deputy to the American ambassador in Damascus While there are no widely recognized names   State Department officials are known to share their concerns Mr Kerry himself has pushed for stronger American action against Syria in part to force a diplomatic solution on Mr Assad The president has resisted such pressure and has been backed up by his military commanders who have raised questions about what would happen in the event that Mr Assad was forced from power     a scenario that the draft memo does not address The State Department spokesman John Kirby declined to comment on the memo which top officials had just received But he said Mr Kerry respected the process as a way for employees to express policy views candidly and privately to senior leadership  Robert S Ford a former ambassador to Syria said Many people working on Syria for the State Department have long urged a tougher policy with the Assad government as a means of facilitating arrival at a negotiated political deal to set up a new Syrian government  Mr Ford who is now a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute resigned from the Foreign Service in 2014 out of frustration with the administrations   policy toward the conflict In the memo the State Department officials wrote that the Assad governments continuing violations of the partial   known as a cessation of hostilities will doom efforts to broker a political settlement because Mr Assad will feel no pressure to negotiate with the moderate opposition or other factions fighting him The governments barrel bombing of civilians it said is the root cause of the instability that continues to grip Syria and the broader region  The moral rationale for taking steps to end the deaths and suffering in Syria after five years of brutal war is evident and unquestionable it said The status quo in Syria will continue to present increasingly dire if not disastrous humanitarian diplomatic and   challenges  The memo acknowledged that military action would have risks not the least further tensions with Russia which has intervened in the war on Mr Assads behalf and helped negotiate a   Those tensions increased on Thursday when according to a senior Pentagon official Russia conducted airstrikes in southern Syria against   forces fighting the Islamic State The State Department officials insisted in their memo that they were not advocating for a slippery slope that ends in a military confrontation with Russia but rather a credible threat of military action to keep Mr Assad in line Once that threat was in place the memo said Mr Kerry could undertake a diplomatic mission similar to the one he led with Iran on its nuclear program The expression of dissent came a week after Mr Assad showed renewed defiance of the United States and other countries vowing to retake every inch of his country from his enemies The   which Mr Kerry helped negotiate in Munich last winter has never really taken hold Mr Assad has continued to block humanitarian convoys despite a warning that the United Nations would begin airdrops of food to starving towns There is an enormous frustration in the bureaucracy about Syria policy said Andrew J Tabler a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near Eastern Policy Whats brought this to a head now is the real downturn in the negotiations not just between the U S and Russia but between Assad and the opposition  Last month Mr Kerry rejected the suggestion that the United States and its allies would never use force to stop the bombings or enforce humanitarian access If President Assad has come to a conclusion theres no Plan B he said then hes come to a conclusion that is totally without any foundation whatsoever and even dangerous  Still Mr Obama has shown little sign of shifting his focus from the campaign against the Islamic State     a strategy that probably acquired even more urgency after the mass shooting Sunday in Orlando Fla In the memo the State Department officials argued that military action against Mr Assad would help the fight against the Islamic State because it would bolster moderate Sunnis who are necessary allies against the group also known as ISIS or ISIL While the State Department has a tradition of being open to dissent     in the 1990s Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with Foreign Service officers who had written a   dissent on the Clinton administrations Balkans policy     Mr Christopher and his successors have been frustrated when these classified memos become public In this case the memo mainly confirms what has been clear for some time The State Departments rank and file have chafed at the White Houses refusal to be drawn into the conflict in Syria During a debate in June 2013 after the Assad government had used chemical weapons against its own people Mr Kerry brandished a State Department report that argued that the United States needed to respond militarily or Mr Assad would view it as green light for continued CW use  Three years later the sense of urgency at the State Department has not diminished The memo concludes It is time that the United States guided by our strategic interests and moral convictions lead a global effort to put an end to this conflict

Why couldnt Kaepernick just be normal and do something good for kids Why so secretive Why push such an extreme political agenda from an extremist group

84,84,Trumps Immigration Policies Explained  The New York Times,Nicholas Kulish Vivian Yee Caitlin Dickerson Liz Robbins Fernanda Santos and Jennifer Medina,With an executive order last month and a pair of Department of Homeland Security memos on Tuesday the Trump administration has significantly hardened the countrys policies regarding illegal immigration Here are some of the most significant elements of the new approach In 2014 the Obama administration issued guidelines for deporting unauthorized immigrants that placed the highest priority on gang members felons and those who posed security threats A goal was to concentrate limited resources on the most serious cases but many Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents complained that the priorities tied their hands taking away their discretion as to whom to pursue Under the new directives the government no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement  Immigration agents can now focus on picking up and removing anyone charged with or convicted of any criminal offense even minor ones as well as anyone already ordered deported regardless of whether they have a criminal record One unauthorized immigrant in California Kristina who did not want her last name used because of fear of deportation said she was alarmed to learn on Tuesday that she would now be considered a prime target Kristina has been in the country for 25 years and has been ordered deported but her removal had been postponed for the last four years by the Obama administration We have our whole lives here our children are citizens she said Now I dont know if I can go out if I should drive  But the Obama guidelines translated into de facto protections for people with no legal right to live in the United States said Dan Stein president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform which opposes legalization for unauthorized immigrants Unless they fell into one of the   categories Mr Stein said the chance of being deported was virtually zero  Under the Obama administration people caught crossing the border without permission were often released into the United States while their requests for asylum wound through the immigration system a process that can take years Most requests are denied but by then the immigrant has been living in the United States all that time and may not be easy to find The Trump administration has declared an end to the   catch and release policy though it may take awhile to see any significant change Catch and release came about in part because the government had nowhere to hold detainees waiting for immigration decisions One of the memos released on Tuesday directs officials to expand detention facilities but it will take time to build centers big enough or find enough room in jails to hold the thousands of Mexican and Central American asylum seekers expected to cross the border this year The document also raises another alternative sending migrants back to Mexico to wait out the immigration process even those who are not originally from Mexico That proposal comes with its own problems Though United States law appears to allow it Mexicos laws do not if the immigrant is not a Mexican citizen Two decades ago Congress passed a law allowing the government to quickly deport undocumented immigrants who have not been in the United States very long without allowing them go before a judge In practice the government has used this process called expedited removal relatively narrowly because of concerns about whether it violates constitutional rights of due process that are granted to anyone in the United States regardless of immigration status Since 2002 expedited removal has been applied only to immigrants who have been in the country less than two weeks and were caught within 100 miles of the border That is because the Supreme Court has held that such immigrants can still be considered in transit and not here long enough to qualify for due process protections The Trump administration is now planning to use expedited removal as extensively as the original law allows saying that limits on its use had contributed to a backlog of more than half a million cases in immigration court Immigration advocates vowed to challenge the change Someone could be living in Chicago for a year and a half and then be swept off the street by an ICE agent said Lee Gelernt deputy director of the A C L Us Immigrants Rights Project referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents He is going to be detained and removed right away without ever seeing a judge  One of the memos on Tuesday acknowledges that children who arrive at the border alone     unaccompanied alien children in government parlance     are entitled to special protections Unlike other border crossers whom border patrol agents may deport without a legal hearing these children must appear before an immigration judge and be interviewed by an asylum officer Children have surged across the border in recent years many fleeing violence and destitution in Central America But the memo turns a sterner face to their parents who under the new policy may be subject to deportation or even prosecution for enabling their children to come into the country The memo notes that parents and relatives often pay smugglers several thousand dollars to bring their children from Central America an act that the memo says amounts to facilitating illegal smuggling or trafficking Immigration advocates are predicting that the policy will drive parents of migrant children further underground With parents fearful of prosecution advocates say navigating the immigration process     or even showing up to court     could become much harder for these children Some 750 000 people who were brought into the country as children were issued work permits and temporary protection from deportation under an Obama program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA Even President Trump said last week that the subject is very very difficult for him and that he promised to deal with DACA with heart  So far the Trump administration has left the program alone But chills went through the community of Dreamers as DACA recipients are known with the recent arrest of a    Mexican immigrant in Washington State Daniel Ramirez Immigration agents arrested him when they went to his house to detain his father a convicted drug trafficker They said Mr Ramirez admitted to having gang affiliations which cancels the protection offered under DACA But Mr Ramirez denies having made the admission and his lawyers are fighting his deportation A program known as 287 g named for its section of the Immigration and Nationality Act allows the Department of Homeland Security to train local and state law enforcement officers to work as de facto federal immigration officers identifying undocumented immigrants in their communities and jails and turning them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement From 2006 to 2013 the program led to 175 000 deportations according to federal statistics But investigations and court rulings revealed an ugly side effect In some jurisdictions local officers were using their authority to racially profile Latinos One of the most egregious cases was in Maricopa County Arizonas most populous during the tenure of Sheriff Joseph Arpaio who a federal judge ruled had discriminated against Latinos in patrols and other enforcement efforts The Obama administration curtailed the use of the program which currently involves 32 agencies in 16 states The Trump administration wants more agencies to take part and some have already expressed a desire to do so The administration is trying to significantly expand the amount of information available on the enforcement of immigration laws and in particular unauthorized immigrants who commit crimes Immigration and Customs Enforcement will establish a new office to work with the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants some of whom appeared with Mr Trump on the campaign trail The office known as Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement or Voice will provide victims with information about defendants immigration status and whether they are in jail Significantly funding for the office comes from reallocating any and all resources that are currently used to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens by Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE will now have to provide monthly public reports on its apprehensions and releases The agency also has to publish a weekly report about state and local authorities that release undocumented immigrants from jails That is a clear shot across the bow at   sanctuary cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities contending that turning in unauthorized immigrants would destroy the fragile relationship that the police have with immigrant communities We are going to continue our policy that has been in place because we think that it helps us have a safer stronger better community Mayor Stephanie A Miner of Syracuse said on Tuesday The Trump administration is already pondering ways to punish those cities by denying them some federal aid Now everyone is going to be able to see how many criminal aliens are being released as a result of the sanctuary policies said Jessica Vaughan director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies which supports tighter controls on immigration In January 2009 the departing Bush administration extended some Privacy Act rights which American citizens and legal permanent residents already had to undocumented immigrants That meant that information obtained by one agency like the Internal Revenue Service or Citizenship and Immigration Services could not generally be shared with other agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement One rationale for the move was to protect the personal information of immigrants who might one day become citizens covered by the Privacy Act The Trump administration has now rescinded those privacy protections One of the memos released on Tuesday said that those protections had been detrimental to the families of the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants because those families could not get information about such defendants legal status or whether they had been deported leaving victims feeling marginalized and without a voice  The Department of Homeland Security said it would develop new rules on the sharing of undocumented immigrants private information But advocates for unauthorized immigrants said they feared that immigrants who had applied for legal status     in the process divulging they were not here legally     were now in danger of having that information used to deport them The constitution doesnt traditionally allow bait and switches said Thomas A Saenz the president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund an organization that advocates for immigrants These are folks who submitted their information attempting to play by the rules with part of the rules being that the government would protect their privacy  The memos released on Tuesday repeat Mr Trumps demand in his executive order for a larger enforcement force that can speed up the removal of millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States In practice that may play out more slowly than the president might prefer The source of this caution is none other than John F Kelly the homeland security secretary who told lawmakers this month that he did not believe it would be possible to hire the desired 15 000 ICE and border patrol agents in the next couple of years Id rather have fewer and make sure that theyre   people Mr Kelly told lawmakers I will not skimp on the training and the standards  On top of the stringent hiring standards and training Border Patrol applicants are required to take a polygraph test which nearly 60 percent fail A previous surge in hiring under President George W Bush resulted in dozens of corruption cases with Border Patrol and other agents accused of taking bribes and providing information to Mexican drug cartels,0,with an executive order last month and a pair of department of homeland security memos on tuesday the trump administration has significantly hardened the countrys

88,88,Fox Biz Reporter Cant Help But Bash Clintons Rally After Covering Trumps Packed Event Day Before,Kayla Brandon,"Share on Twitter 
The battle of campaign rallies has been going strong throughout the 2016 presidential election with both candidates amassing pretty large crowds 
Just last month the Washington Post compared two separate September rallies for both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton 
Trumps had a crowd of 15000 at his Sept 27th rally in Melbourne Florida Unbelievable evening in Melbourne Florida w 15000 supporters and an additional 12000 who could not get in Thank you TrumpTrain MAGA pictwittercom2N3Xq7AGmx  Donald J Trump realDonaldTrump September 28 2016 
while Clinton had a crowd of roughly 1400 people in Raleigh North Carolina that same day Hillary Clinton rallies in Raleigh NC the day after the debate pictwittercompvWndH0zlK  Sabrina Siddiqui SabrinaSiddiqui September 27 2016 
It appears as though Fox Business reporter Adam Shapiro felt the need to compare Trump and Hillarys crowd attendance too 
At a West Palm Beach rally Wednesday Shapiro said there appeared to be roughly a thousand Hillary supporters at Palm Beach State College which was a sizable difference to Trumps rally the day before 
Its nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in Sanford Florida yesterday for Mr Trump  15000 
Take a look Stewart camera pans crowd 
Theres maybe 1000 to 2000 people here today The Clinton rallies tend to be much smaller and you can see theres empty space here Image Credit Screenshot YouTube 
He just couldnt stop talking about it adding that if they were covering a Trump rally the room would be packed

90,90,Mike Birbiglias 6 Tips for Making It Small in Hollywood Or Anywhere  The New York Times,Mike Birbiglia,This summer I went on a   tour with my movie Dont Think Twice a comedy about an improv group that has to decide whether to stay in show business when one member is plucked for a Saturday Night Live type of show At every Q and A session for the movie people would ask the same question If I want to be a comedian or actor or writer or improviser or film director how do I get started The truth is they should probably pick someone more successful to ask     I make small films small   shows Off Broadway and small comedy specials for Netflix     but Im the person who showed up to talk to them And now Im the person offering you unsolicited advice     so if you dont need it or want it this is not for you Anyway Ive boiled my answer down to six ideas 1 DONT WAIT Write Make a short film Go to an open mike Take an improv class Theres no substitute for actually doing something Dont talk about it anymore Maybe dont even finish reading this essay 2 FAIL Dont worry about failing Theres a great video where Ira Glass explains that when you start in a new field your work wont be as good as your taste It will take years for your taste and the quality of your work to intersect If ever Failure is essential Theres no substitute for it Its not just encouraged but required The bedrock of all good pieces of writing is 10 bad drafts Maybe 20 I wrote 12 drafts of Dont Think Twice 14 drafts of my first movie Sleepwalk With Me and worked on my first   show for six years My first   set on Late Show With David Letterman in 2002 was mined from three hours of   material that I had tried and failed with for six years 3 LEARN FROM THE FAILURE This is where it becomes important to find a community of people you respect People who have good taste People who might not be good at something themselves but know what good is They might be in a theater company at an improv school or live in your dorm They arent the easiest thing to find When I was in college every Wednesday I drove my girlfriend Maggies Ford Taurus to an open mike at a Best Western 40 minutes away to enter a lottery of 30 comedians trying to win one of the nine spots to perform in front of the other angry 21 comedians It sucked People didnt like my comedy there I didnt love theirs It wasnt a fit But then I got a job working as a door person at the DC Improv comedy club in Washington and that was a fit Around the same time I was cast in my college improv group So all at once I met people whom I could bounce jokes and ideas off of Theyd give me candid feedback and I tried to listen I wasnt great at it at first Its hard to hear criticism But Ive learned that harsh feedback constructive feedback even weird random feedback is all helpful if you know the essence of what youre trying to convey I once heard an interview where Ron Howard said that he tests the rough cuts of his movies with a ton of audiences He doesnt do it to be told what the movies vision should be but to understand whether his vision is coming across If not he makes changes Your vision is not being conveyed a majority of the time With Dont Think Twice I workshopped the script like the way I workshop my standup I invited friends over to read it out loud in my living room and then fed them pizza The pizza was excellent The script often wasnt So Id get my friends all drunk on pizza and then ask them hard questions like What do you like least about the script Be honest I can take it  Thats where I learned the most 4 MAYBE QUIT You might not be meant to be a writer or performer or improviser You might be meant to teach kids math or raise money for a food bank or start a company that makes Rubiks Cubes for babies Dont rule out quitting There is going to be an insane amount of work ahead and your time might be spent better elsewhere There was a great column in The New York Times recently where Angela Duckworth writes Rather than ask What do I want to be when I grow up ask In what way do I wish the world were different What problem can I help solve This puts the focus where it should be     on how you can serve other people  5 BE BOLD ENOUGH TO MAKE STUFF THATS SMALL BUT GREAT Eight years ago I made a network sitcom pilot based on my life It was a dream come true A sitcom about my life What could be better than that for a standup comedian Well it didnt get picked up I was devastated But heres the kicker Failing to get that sitcom was the single greatest stroke of luck thats happened in my entire career The show wasnt truly my comedic voice It was watered down by network and studio notes to the point of being like dozens of other bland sitcoms After that I no longer wanted to create projects for the Hollywood gatekeepers The networks The studios Since then Ive created a handful of pieces for This American Life   three Off Broadway   shows toured hundreds of cities around the world and written directed and starred in two feature films All outside the system Based on that work Ive been offered small movie roles by people who work inside the system Which is to say Leaving the system behind and creating something of your own may actually be thing that gets you into the system hopefully on your own terms The point is forget the gatekeepers As far as Im concerned what you create in a       improv theater in Phoenix can be far more meaningful than a mediocre sitcom being   by seven million people America doesnt need more stuff We need more great stuff You could make that 6 CLEVERNESS IS OVERRATED AND HEART IS UNDERRATED Plus there are fewer people competing for heart so you have a better chance of getting noticed Sometimes people say One thing you have to offer in your work is yourself  I disagree I think its the only thing,0,this summer i went on a tour with my movie dont think twice a comedy about an improv group that has to decide whether to stay in show business when

91,91,Investment Strategist Forecasts Collapse Timeline The Last Gasp Of This Economic Cycle Will Come In 2018,Mac Slavo,"It is no longer a question of whether or not financial markets and the US economy will collapse That according to a host of experts both mainstream and alternative is a given 
The only question now is when that moment will come 
According to Christine Hughes chief investment strategist at Otterwood Capital  it will be very soon Basing her assessment on historically deadon yield curve analysis Hughes says in her latest update to clients that were looking at a maximum breaking point of 2020 but that some time in the next 12  15 months is the more likely scenario which pegs the next crisis right at the beginning of 2018  
First the chart which has been near perfect in its accuracy thus far and shows just how rapidly the yield curve has collapsed in the last 12 months 
Hughes explains what it means for you and why you can expect 2018 to be the year of reckoning 
As the bond market sees a recession slower growth means lower interest rates and it the yield curve collapses So lets assume were like every other time in history and that happens Then it moves forward to 2018 
So 2018 according to the yield curve is pretty much the last gasp we have for this economic cycle Were closing in on 2016 now we basically have a year maybe a year to 15 months before we have the next crisis on our hands 
So if you are levered personally or corporately if a lot of your assets are in illiquid stuff the Canadian housing market comes to mind You might want to think about existing and liquefying yourself 
Watch the video report 
Wolf Richter of Wolf Street explains why the Treasury Yield Curve is so important 
Since early July the 30year US Treasury Bond Price Index has plunged 83 Its now called the rout in longerdated government bonds One of the specters is rising inflation at a time of ultralow yields 
What has become the number one predictor of a bear market in stocks over the past many decades The US Treasury yield curve It drives bank lending  which can strangle the economy But this time the risks are much higher and the potential economic consequences steeper 
We know it is only a matter of time at this point 
Greg Mannarino of Traders Choice has made similar warnings noting that the bond markets are signaling a massive crash ahead And when that crash finally takes place the fall out after the debt bubble bursts according to Mannarino could lead to extremely serious consequences 
So when the debt bubble bursts were going to get a correction in population Its a mathematical certainty 
Millions upon millions of people are going to die on a worldwide scale when the debt bubble bursts And Im saying when not if 
 
When resources become more and more scarce were going to see countries at war with each other People will be scrambling in a worst case scenario doing everything that they can to survive to provide for their family and for themselves 
Theres no way out of it 
If Mannarino and Hughes are right you have about a year to get ready for the next leg of the collapse

92,92,Venezuela Muzzles Legislature Moving Closer to OneMan Rule  The New York Times,Nicholas Casey and Patricia Torres,IQUITOS Peru     Venezuela took its strongest step yet toward   rule under the leftist President Nicolás Maduro as his loyalists on the Supreme Court seized power from the National Assembly in a ruling late Wednesday night The ruling effectively dissolved the elected legislature which is led by Mr Maduros opponents and allows the court to write laws itself experts said The move caps a year in which the last vestiges of Venezuelas democracy have been torn down critics and regional leaders say leaving what many now describe as not just an authoritarian regime but an outright dictatorship What we have warned of has finally come to pass said Luis Almagro the head of the Organization of American States a regional diplomacy group that includes Venezuela and is investigating the country for violating the blocs Democratic Charter Mr Almagro called the move a   coup a term used in Latin America to denote takeovers typical of the 1990s in Guatemala and Peru     but virtually   in the region today Recent months have seen a swift consolidation of power by Mr Maduro as scores of political prisoners have been detained without trial protesters violently repressed and local elections postponed In taking power from the National Assembly the ruling removed what most consider to be the only remaining counterbalance to the presidents growing power in the country The court said that lawmakers were in a situation of contempt and that while that lasted the justices themselves would step in to ensure that parliamentary powers were exercised directly by this chamber or by the body that the chamber chooses  It did not say whether it might hand power back Members of the National Assembly denounced the ruling on Thursday They have kidnapped the Constitution they have kidnapped our rights they have kidnapped our liberty said Julio Borges the opposition lawmaker who heads the body holding a crumpled copy of the ruling before reporters on Thursday Oneida Guaipe an opposition lawmaker from the countrys central coast said the body would continue to do its work even if its laws would now be ignored when it produced legislation This is demonstrating before the world the authoritarianism here she said The people chose us through a popular vote  The ruling was also a challenge to Venezuelas neighbors which met in Washington this week to put pressure on the country to hold elections and to discuss a possible expulsion of Venezuela from the O A S on the grounds that the country is not democratic Last week the United States Canada and a dozen of Latin Americas largest nations called for Mr Maduro to recognize the National Assemblys powers a rare joint statement that reflected deep impatience with his government We consider it a serious setback for democracy in Venezuela the United States State Department said on Thursday of the court decision Peru withdrew its ambassador in protest David Smilde an analyst from the Washington Office on Latin America a human rights advocacy group said it might now be up to Venezuelas neighbors to encourage the country to hold elections again given resistance from within the government The Maduro government seems to have no intention of respecting the basic elements of electoral democracy he said Critics say a long litany of other moves by the government are taking a toll on Venezuelas democracy Perhaps most visible to Venezuelans was an effort last year to hold a recall referendum against the president whose popularity is sinking along with the countrys collapsing economy While such a referendum was permitted by the countrys Constitution and highly favored in polls Mr Maduro alternatively called the effort illegal or a coup staged by his opponents In October a lower court suspended the process on the grounds that there had been irregularities in the gathering of signatures Meanwhile political prisoners continued to be arrested In January Mr Maduro established a new   commando to round up political dissidents accused of treason The group has taken aim at members of the opposition arresting many including a city councilman from central Venezuela and a deputy lawmaker in the National Assembly In February after CNN en Español the networks Spanish language channel broadcast an investigation that linked Venezuelas vice president to a passport fraud scheme in the Middle East Mr Maduro ordered the channel off the air The government has blocked the Caracas bureau chief of The New York Times from entering the country since October But to many the gradual assault against the National Assembly more than a year in the making was the most telling sign of democratic erosion in Venezuela It has come in fragments Carlos Ayala Corao a Venezuelan lawyer and legal analyst said of the courts actions against the legislature They have been slicing it in pieces  The conflicts began in December 2015 when rising grievances about the countrys faltering economy propelled Mr Maduros opposition to win control of the legislature It was the first time in years that the chamber was not dominated by the movement founded by the former leftist President Hugo Chávez Mr Maduro initially said he accepted the vote He even appeared before opposition lawmakers to give his annual address on the state of the government in January of last year But the Supreme Court packed with loyalists to Mr Maduro shortly before the National Assembly took power was chipping away at the chambers powers It refused to let it seat four lawmakers on the grounds that there had been voting irregularities That denied the opposition of a supermajority which would have given it expanded powers over Mr Maduro The National Assembly went back and forth on the ruling but eventually complied As the National Assembly began to get to work it continued to clash with the court By last spring the legislature had written laws delivering on campaign promises like one measure to invigorate the economy and another to free more than 100 political prisoners only to see the court overturn them as unconstitutional When Mr Maduro tried to increase his own powers under a state of emergency that he declared the legislature rejected the effort But the court sided with the president In October the court stripped the National Assembly of its power to review the annual budget leaving Mr Maduro in charge of the countrys purse strings More recently legislators tried to block the president from pursuing oil ventures without their approval In Wednesdays ruling stripping the National Assembly of its lawmaking powers the court said the president had the right to make these oil deals It said its ruling was justified by the Assemblys choice to keep the lawmakers onboard whose elections had been questioned earlier This act it said rendered the Assembly itself invalid With few protesters in the streets of Caracas on Thursday it was unclear what popular support the opposition might get from the public Analysts say many Venezuelans feel as dispirited by the opposition as by leftist leaders given the oppositions continued defeat by the government Opposition leaders called for protests on Saturday and in the coming week but have been unable to draw large crowds since last fall John Magdaleno a political consultant said he expected a wider crackdown against the opposition from Mr Maduro in coming weeks and possibly more arrests In my opinion from now on there will be growing pressures against lawmakers he said and its probable there will be much greater persecution of political leaders ,0,iquitos peru venezuela took its strongest step yet toward rule under the leftist president maduro as

95,95,White House Confirms More Gitmo Transfers Before Obama Leaves Office,Edwin Mora,President Barack Obama will likely release more prisoners from the U S military prison in Guantánamo Bay Cuba before incoming    Donald Trump takes over on January 20 the White House press secretary reiterated on Thursday That same day reports confirmed that the U S transferred four detainees to Saudi Arabia  The Daily Mail has placed the number of 11th hour transfers at 22 including the four recently sent to Saudi Arabia adding that the group of prisoners who are expected to be released will include jihadists who have threatened to behead and bomb Americans Prior to the Daily Mail article and recent transfers the number of prisoners who are expected to be set free by the time Obama leaves the White House varied by news agencies ranging from 17 to 19 a move that would reduce the current detainee population at the Guantánamo facility to between 40 and 42 On Thursday Josh Earnest the White House spokesman told reporters I am not able to speak to any specific detainee transfers between now and January 20th other than to confirm for you that there are likely to be some  And whenever those transfers take place once they have been completed we announce them publicly  And that will continue to be our approach through January 20th  And my expectation is that there will be some additional announcements of that type Asked about the risk of detainees   in terrorist activity against the United States Earnest boasted that only nine of the prisoners transferred since Obama took office have been confirmed by the intelligence community as having returned to militant activity compared to 21 percent 113 of 532 under the previous administration a figure often touted by Democrats However Earnest failed to mention that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ODNI figure nine that he highlights refers to   as of July 2016 when 161 detainees had been released by Obama not the 183 he mentioned on Thursday The nine confirmed   includes one deceased detainee and accounts for six percent of the 161 prisoners who had been released under Obama as of July 2016 Moreover the number of prisoners released before 2009 exceeds those liberated under Obama more than   3 3 which may account for the higher rate of confirmed   under George W Bush The White House spokesman attributed the low percentage of   under Obama to the presidents     panel known as the Periodic Review Board PRB that has cleared for release all the prisoners transferred out after 2009 including   forever prisoners or those believed to be too dangerous to release Since President Obama took office and since these reforms were initiated nine detainees have been confirmed by the intelligence community of reengaging in the fight Earnest said on Thursday Considering that we have released 183 detainees during President Obamas time in office a little     math would indicate that our percentage is much better and its a result of the reforms that President Obama instituted on his first day in office  According to ODNI 20 out of 161 detainees 12 percent had been confirmed nine or suspected 11 to have returned to terrorist activities under Obamas watch as of July 2016 Under the Bush administration 188 out of 532 35 percent are confirmed 113 or suspected 75 to have   in terrorism When taken as a whole if there were 20 detainees confirmed or suspected to have   in terrorism for every 161 detainees released under Bush like during the Obama administration the overall rate of terror returnees before 2009 would be closer to 40 percent not 35 In late December the Chicago Tribune citing U S officials reported that the Obama administration has shared its plans with Congress to transfer out as many as 19 detainees held at Guantánamo Bay Cuba Of the 55 prisoners still held at Gitmo 18 have been cleared for release by Obamas PRB and more than half 27 are considered forever prisoners or too dangerous to release Nevertheless Obama has already released prisoners who had been designated too dangerous to release The remaining 10 prisoners are believed to still be undergoing war crimes proceedings at military commissions including at least six who were facing death penalty tribunals as of late last year On Friday the Pentagon announced that four detainees     Salem Ahmad Hadi Bin Kanad Muhammed Rajab Sadiq Abu Ghanim Abdallah Yahya Yusif   and Muhammad Ali Abdallah Muhammad Bwazir     had been transferred to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia All four detainees are from   Yemen which shares a border with Saudi Arabia At least two individuals     Kanad and Ghanim     had been linked to the Taliban when they were apprehended and taken to the Guantánamo prison also known as Gitmo Meanwhile the    Bwazir has been directly linked to Osama bin Laden   also affiliated with   was born in Saudi Arabia but is a citizen of Yemen according to the U S military In December 2007 the U S

98,98,Migrants Confront Judgment Day Over Old Deportation Orders  The New York Times,Vivian Yee,There are a little more than two weeks between Juan an electrician in the Bronx and the date he cannot forget March 21 2017 at 8 a m when the federal government has told him to report for deportation Two weeks to decide Avoid it and try to preserve the American life he has built for a little longer even as a fugitive Go and lose it all his wife and son his job his apartment his world I would feel like an animal if I stay here and hide said Juan 29 who asked that his last name not be used I want to prove that I can follow the laws I want to make my case at this meeting but I know that if I go theyre going to deport me  In an immigration system mottled with escape hatches and hobbled by scant resources Juan who fled Colombia six years ago is one of nearly a million people who have managed to linger in the United States despite having been ordered out of the country by an immigration judge     some of them more than a decade ago And with the Trump administration intent on sweeping perhaps millions of immigrants without legal status out of the country the White House has not had to look far to make a quick mark Because people with deportation orders have had their day in court most of them can be sent out of the country without seeing a judge sometimes within hours of being arrested People who have been ordered deported and who are still here are the   fruit said Stephen   an immigration law professor at Cornell University Trump has said he has wanted to deport more people The easiest way to get those numbers up are to take those people whove been ordered deported and go after them  President Trumps immigration agency has already offered what looks like a preview Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents recently deported to Mexico an Arizona  mother who had been ordered out of the country four years ago But the   will be complicated The backlog of what the government calls fugitive aliens has persisted through Republican and Democratic administrations inflamed conservatives who oppose illegal immigration and resisted the immigration authorities attempts at enforcement Since 2006 even as the overall total of unauthorized immigrants in the United States has dipped the number facing outstanding deportation orders has grown by more than half to around 962 000 people from 632 726 More than half of them come from Mexico El Salvador Guatemala or Honduras Another 13 200 or so as of early February were already in the custody of customs officials Despite the Bush and Obama administrations   commitments to focus on expelling those who pose a serious danger to their communities slightly less than one in five people facing deportation has been convicted of a crime in the United States The causes for delays can vary Deportations have been deferred for humanitarian reasons     like allowing mothers to stay with sick children in the United States     or they have been frozen while an appeal is mounted The Obama administration put off deportations for thousands of immigrants it did not consider priorities including Juan the Bronx electrician and Guadalupe García de Rayos the Arizona mother often   people with strong ties to their communities Felons not families criminals not children President Barack Obama said in 2014 describing the kinds of people he wanted deported The government also postponed deportations for people who were likely to face torture if they were sent back Some deportations are simply impossible to carry out About a quarter of the immigrants with outstanding deportation orders come from countries that refuse to take back deportees including China Haiti Brazil and India Mr Trump has threatened to stop issuing visas to people from these countries In the past diplomats have urged caution on this front not wanting to disrupt international relationships over the issue of deportees And many people under final orders have slipped through gaping cracks in the immigration system Court notices     either mailed to outdated addresses or illegible to Spanish speakers     are routinely missed leaving judges to issue deportation orders for people who miss their chance to argue their case Nearly a quarter of judges decisions rendered in 2015 for example involved cases where the immigrant in question was absent The months and sometimes years it takes for immigration and asylum cases to wind through a clogged court system can cause the authorities to lose track of immigrants living and working in the country because they have fled or simply moved The White House has sought to make it harder for immigrants to be remain free inside the United States while their requests for asylum plod through the courts They will be detained more often or asked to wait in Mexico until a judge can rule There are all kinds of things in the system that werent built to maximize compliance said David A Martin a professor of immigration law at the University of Virginia and a former immigration official in the Obama and Clinton administrations It led to a climate he said that has prompted many people to not consider a deportation order a serious matter And thats one of the attitudes that sometimes infuriates with some justification people who voted for Donald Trump  In a significant break from his predecessor Mr Trump is directing immigration agents to go after virtually anyone who is in the United States illegally ending the reprieve for people who had not been considered priorities Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed one line of Mr Trumps executive order on immigration reads with the crispness of a traffic sign What has been lacking up until a month ago is a willingness and a commitment on the part of the administration to actually do it said Ira Mehlman a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform which supports stricter immigration controls Nothing is easy he said but going after people who already have deportation orders will be the easiest part of enforcing the presidents removal priorities  President George W Bushs administration dented the backlog by deploying fugitive teams that were supposed to track down unauthorized immigrants with deportation orders and criminal records But the strategy drew a backlash when the raids began snaring undocumented immigrants who were not targets That was something that caused a lot of controversy and a lot of anxiety in immigrant communities because it meant these officers could stop anyone at any time said Randy Capps the director of research at the Migration Policy Institute a nonpartisan think tank Mr Capps added that while the Obama administration narrowed the scope of such raids he expected the Trump administration to return to the Bush model There is of course an easier way to find some people with final orders Wait for them to walk into ICE

outcomes going to be next time she said adding that she had asked her brother to help her husband care for her four children if she was deported In the case of Juan the electrician nothing remains to stop the government from acting on the deportation order he first received in 2013 Juan had requested asylum after paramilitary forces in Colombia tried to kill him he said but he lost his final

99,99,MIT NYU and Yale Are Sued Over Retirement Plan Fees  The New York Times,Tara Siegel Bernard,Three prominent universities were sued on Tuesday accused of allowing their employees to be charged excessive fees on their retirement savings The universities     the Massachusetts Institute of Technology New York University and Yale     each have retirement plans holding more than 3 billion in assets and are being individually sued by a number of their employees in cases seeking   status The lawyer representing the three groups of plaintiffs Jerome J Schlichter is a pioneer in retirement plan litigation Over the last decade he has filed more than 20 lawsuits on behalf of workers in 401 k retirement plans and has been widely credited with lowering plan fees across corporate America With the suits filed in federal courts on Tuesday the focus has turned to a   corner of the retirement savings market 403 b plans which are named for a section of the tax code The accounts are similar to 401 k plans but are offered by public schools and nonprofit institutions like universities and hospitals The complaints allege that the universities as the plan sponsors failed to monitor excessive fees paid to administer the plans and did not replace more expensive   investments with cheaper ones Had the plans eliminated their long lists of investment options and used their bargaining power to cut costs the complaints argue participants could have collectively saved tens of millions of dollars It is important for retirees and employees of universities to have the same rights and ability to build their retirement assets as employees of   companies said Mr Schlichter a founding partner of Schlichter Bogard  Denton in St Louis They shouldnt be penalized  In a statement New York University said that it took the welfare of its faculty and employees seriously including a dignified retirement The retirement plans offered to them are chosen and administered carefully and prudently We will litigate this case vigorously and expect to prevail said John Beckman a university spokesman A spokeswoman for M I T said it did not comment on pending litigation while Yale said it was cautious and careful in administering its plans and would defend itself vigorously More attention is being paid to investment costs shouldered by American workers who are less likely today to have pension plans With the strong support of the Obama administration the Labor Department introduced new rules in April to strengthen investor protections requiring a broader group of financial professionals to act in customers best interest when handling their retirement money The aim is to reduce conflicts of interest and the fees consumers pay Even modest reductions in costs can have a significant effect on retirees savings An   example from the Labor Department Paying one percentage point more in fees over a   career     say 1 5 percent instead of 0 5 percent     could leave a worker with 28 percent less at retirement An account with 25 000     and no further contributions for those 35 years     would rise to only 163 000 instead of 227 000 at an annual rate of 7 percent Mr Schlichter said the three universities plans were targeted because more people were asking questions about their retirement accounts and these involve clear breaches of the law  The complaint against N Y U     which involves two 403 b plans covering faculty research administration and the medical school     centers largely on costs The complaint said that participants were offered too many investment choices there were more than 100 options for faculty and that many of them were too expensive The suit filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York singles out several investments including the TIAA Traditional Annuity which it said has severe restrictions and penalties for withdrawal as well as variable annuities that have several layers of fees and have historically underperformed A spokesman for TIAA said it offered   plans and   investments that provide lifetime income The suit also argues that even the cheapest funds offered could have been provided for less given the enormous size and bargaining power of the faculty and medical school plans which together held 4 2 billion in assets for more than 24 000 participants at the end of 2014 The complaint alleges that the university did not use its negotiating powers to select a single   record keeper for administrative tasks such as sending statements to employees It said it also overpaid for these services for many years The issues concerning Yales 403 b retirement plan     which held nearly 3 6 billion in assets in the spring of 2014     follow a similar pattern multiple record keepers with excessive fees costing participants millions of dollars over the last six years too many investments of the same style and the use of   funds instead of identical but   ones That case was filed in Federal District Court in Connecticut Yale eventually consolidated to one provider TIAA in April 2015 and swapped in some   investments but the suit claims that the changes did not go far enough to fully protect the interests of its employees Mr Schlichter said participants were still burdened with sorting through more than 100 options many of which were too expensive The complaints lodged against M I T s retirement plan unusually it is a 401 k like those used by corporations are similar but with a twist The suit alleges that the university because of its longstanding relationship with nearby Fidelity did not conduct a thorough search for a plan provider which might have provided better service for less The retirement plan offered more than 340 investment options     including 180 Fidelity funds     until July 2015 when M I T reduced the lineup to 37 options but still retained Fidelity as the record keeper The complaint said that Fidelity had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to M I T while Abigail Johnson Fidelitys chief executive has served as a member of M I T s board of trustees giving her influence over the institutions   Had the plan reduced its options to those on the menu it adopted last year participants would have saved over 8 million in fees in 2014 alone and many millions more since 2010 according to the complaint filed in Federal District Court in Massachusetts M I T recognized that the plan structure was inefficient the filing said since that was part of the reason it said it made the changes But even after the overhaul the suit alleges investment costs could be further reduced Fidelity which noted that it was not a defendant in the case declined to comment Mr Schlichters firm has settled about half of his 20 cases over the last 10 years His first case involving a 403 b was against Novant Health a nonprofit hospital system which settled last year for 32 million In a landmark case he argued last year before the Supreme Court the justices in a unanimous decision agreed that plan sponsors had a continuing duty to monitor investments and remove imprudent ones  A series of suits from Mr Schlichters firm and others continue to be filed in the corporate world Several asset managers including Neuberger Berman and Franklin Resources among others have recently been sued for putting their own investments in their employees 401 k plans Some of the more prominent cases against 401 k plans settled by Mr Schlichter include a 62 million settlement against Lockheed Martin 57 million from Boeing and 27 5 million from Ameriprise all in 2015 He also settled cases with Cigna International Paper Caterpillar General Dynamics Bechtel and Kraft Mr Schlichter said his firm which works on a contingency basis typically collects up to a third of the settlement while the remainder goes to the plaintiffs and members of the class He said that his settlements also required employers to make changes to their plans to ensure fees were reasonable in the future,0,three prominent universities were sued on tuesday accused of allowing their employees to be charged excessive fees on their retirement savings the universities the massachusetts institute of technology new york university and yale each have retirement plans holding more than 3 billion in assets and are being individually sued by a number of their employees in
